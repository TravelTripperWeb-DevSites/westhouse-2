A fresh and modern interpretation of a classic New York City speakeasy boasting an antique fireplace and intimate bar, the lounge features a curated selection of evening light fare and beverages, including the hotel&rsquo;s unique take on the Old Fashioned; the cacao fruit-infused Oldie But Goodie finishes with a smooth kick, and is already causing a stir in trendy magazines. By design, The Den&rsquo;s raised floor means Residents are not eye-level with the street, allowing for a bird&rsquo;s eye view of passersby. Even here on the hotel&rsquo;s first-floor lobby level, the views are quintessential New York as a setting sun at cocktail hour casts golden hues on an elaborate Beaux Art building just across the street.</p>\n<p><strong>Operation Hours: </strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bar opens daily at 5PM</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>",
