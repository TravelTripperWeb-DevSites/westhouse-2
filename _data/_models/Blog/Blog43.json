In celebration of spring, we&rsquo;re sharing the destinations and activities our culture-savvy WestHouse ambassadors look forward to every year. Here, concierge Shawn Harris shares his six favorite art-inspired day trips.</p>\n<p><img id=\"1493275280229\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/92_368_2778/media/2017-04-27-023836/IMG_2638.JPG\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> <a href=\"https://frieze.com/\"><strong>FRIEZE NEW YORK</strong></a>. Every May, Frieze New York spotlights the best in modern and contemporary artwork. It&rsquo;s my pleasure to personally invite you to experience this exceptional art fair in true WestHouse style. This year Frieze New York will be held May 5-7 in Randall&rsquo;s Island Park, and if you <a href=\"http://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/offers/frieze-new-york-hotel-deal/\">book your stay with us now</a>, you&rsquo;ll receive two complimentary one-day tickets to the event.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.diaart.org/visit/visit/diabeacon-beacon-united-states\"><strong>DIA: BEACON</strong></a>. I pop up to Dia: Beacon a few times a year; it&rsquo;s the kind of museum you visit again and again, because its temporary exhibitions are just that good. I&rsquo;m a big lover of contemporary and minimalist art, which is Dia: Beacon&rsquo;s specialty. There&rsquo;s nothing more rewarding than wandering the sprawling complex, taking in the elaborate simplicity of its works. 1 hour and 30 minutes by car, 2 hours by train.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.stonybrook.edu/pkhouse/\"><strong>POLLOCK-KRASNER HOUSE AND STUDIO</strong></a>. You don&rsquo;t have to travel far to see Jackson Pollock&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;drip&rdquo; paintings &mdash; everyone knows his work is prominently on display at the MoMA in Midtown. But not everyone knows that the studio where these masterpieces were created is also nearby. The Pollock-Krasner House and Studio, where Pollock lived with his wife Lee Krasner, takes you inside the artist&rsquo;s process and heightens your appreciation for his work. The floor of his surprisingly small studio is still stained with the paint splatters of his magnificent career. 2 hours and 30 minutes by car, 3 hours by train.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> <a href=\"http://stormking.org/\"><strong>STORM KING ART CENTER</strong></a>. Some of my favorite New York City memories were made wandering the grounds of Storm King. The sculpture park is a 500-acre playground of fields, hills, and over 100 outdoor works of art. You&rsquo;ll spend the majority of your visit outdoors, so be sure to go when the weather is nice. Don&rsquo;t forget your walking shoes! 1 hour by car, 1 hour and 45 minutes by train.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.opus40.org/\"><strong>OPUS 40 SCULPTURE PARK AND MUSEUM</strong></a>. All of these day trips offer an escape from the busy city and promise a renewed sense of calm, but there&rsquo;s something almost meditative about Opus 40. Its artistic magnitude is a testament to its humble origins: Harvey Fite, one of the founders of the Bard College Fine Arts Department, purchased an abandoned quarry and spent 37 years building the six and a half-acre sculpture we now know as Opus 40. In addition to the sculpture, there are hiking trails, pools, the Quarryman&rsquo;s Museum, and more. Opens Memorial Day weekend. 2 hours by car.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>6.</strong> <a href=\"http://aldrichart.org/\"><strong>THE ALDRICH CONTEMPORARY ART MUSEUM</strong></a>. This museum also sits on a storied property: It once housed a church and a general store. Its founder, Larry Aldrich, was a master collector of modern art; before opening the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, he helped grow the collections of the MoMA and the Whitney. Whether you&rsquo;re a modern art lover or a novice, this is the perfect place to dive into the style. 1 hour and 30 minutes by car, 2 hours by train.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>7.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wavehill.org/\"><strong>WAVE HILL</strong></a>. Don&rsquo;t let Wave Hill&rsquo;s proximity to Midtown Manhattan fool you: This cultural center in the Bronx is one of the most serene places in the city. Summertime at Wave Hill means outdoor concerts on the lawn at sunset and exciting exhibits at Glyndor Gallery. If you&rsquo;re in the mood to get in touch with nature, there&rsquo;s also the gorgeous public garden, hiking trail, and views of the Hudson River and Palisades. 35 minutes by car, 55 minutes by train.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Image credits: Artifacts from Isamu Noguchi's studio, Long Island City, NY.
