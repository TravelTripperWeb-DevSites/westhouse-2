New York restaurants have long been known as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/opinion/sexism-in-the-kitchen.html\">macho places</a> that aren&rsquo;t especially friendly to women. But that&rsquo;s changing, thanks in no small part to the women spotlighted here.</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong>Breakfast at Black Seed Bagels</strong></h2>\n<p>By the time you get your hands on a Black Seed bagel, decadently topped with tobiko cream cheese and smoked salmon, head baker Dianna Daoheung has already finished a full work day. She wakes up at 3 a.m. to oversee the boiling and baking of dough that will become famously-thin Montreal-style bagels at this fast-growing bagelry.

Angela Dimayuga earned the job, not through formal education (she has no culinary degrees), but through her inherent talent in the kitchen. She relies on her Filipino upbringing in California&mdash;where cooking was a family affair&mdash;to put a unique spin on traditional Sichuan dishes. Case in point: she takes simple rice cakes and stir-fries them with thrice-cooked bacon, bitter melon and chili paste.

In upping the 30-year-old restaurant&rsquo;s star power, she became the first Swedish-born woman (and only the second in America) to run a two Michelin-starred restaurant.

The sister bakery of the Momofuku culinary empire, Milk Bar is a lifestyle brand that has made it cool for adults to enjoy flavors of childhood junk food. Her iconic takes with unfrosted sides, along with on-the-go snacks like birthday cake truffles and cereal milk-flavored ice cream, are wildly popular with New Yorkers.
