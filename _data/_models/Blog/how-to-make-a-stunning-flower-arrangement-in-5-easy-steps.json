Walk around the city and you&rsquo;ll see that every farmer&rsquo;s market, flower shop, and outdoor cafe is bursting with vibrant hydrangeas and blush-colored peonies. &nbsp;We asked experts who teach floral classes at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the New York Botanical Garden for tips on creating your own arrangements.\n<br><br></p><h3>Choose your container.</h3><br>\n<p id=\"mf116\">\n\nTeacups, buckets, milk bottles—nothing is off limits. Note that the narrower the mouth, the fewer flowers you&rsquo;ll be able to fit. Suzanna Cameron, the owner of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.stemsbrooklyn.com/\" id=\"mfa17\">Stems in Brooklyn</a> and an instructor at the </p><p id=\"mf117\"><a href=\"https://www.bbg.org/\" id=\"mfa18\">Brooklyn Botanic Garden</a>, recommends mason jars because they hold about the same amount of flowers you can grip in your hand. (And they&rsquo;re very on trend.) Trisha O&rsquo;Sullivan, who teaches at the <a href=\"https://www.nybg.org/\" id=\"mfa19\">New York Botanical Garden</a> and runs the blog flowermarket28ny.com, likes to order online from <a href=\"https://www.jamaligarden.com/\" id=\"mfa20\">Jamali Floral &amp; Garden Supplies</a>, which sells hundreds of vases in different shapes, materials, and sizes. Want to use a wicker basket? Make sure to line it with a sturdy plastic bag to catch the water.\n\n</p><h3>Only buy fresh, seasonal flowers.</h3><br><p id=\"mf120\">\nBefore you purchase any bouquets, look at the stems and make sure they&rsquo;re not brown. &ldquo;If you grab flowers with any brownness or mush on the bottom, it means the stems are already oxidizing and they will die a little quicker,&rdquo; Cameron says. Generally speaking, a flower boutique sells the highest quality blooms—but for the freshest, nothing beats a <a href=\"https://www.grownyc.org/greenmarket\" id=\"mfa21\">farmer&rsquo;s market</a>. &ldquo;Local flowers are cut and transported in water, which helps keep them fresh longer,&rdquo; adds Cameron.\n\n</p><h3>Understand the elements.</h3><br><p id=\"mf123\">\nAll great floral arrangements have three things: a foliage base, focal flowers, and texture. The foliage creates the structure, and Cameron recommends working your way around the vessel in a circle, webbing the stems. (If you go with a smaller vase, you can skip the foliage.) Focal flowers should generally have a fuller face, like pincushions, peonies, and roses. Other top picks for spring: hydrangeas, hyacinth, and tulips. Texture is going to come from things like berries, thistles, and curling willow, which you should work in among the flowers. Both O&rsquo;Sullivan and Cameron encourage using simple, everyday items—twigs, moss, branches, even herbs like rosemary. &ldquo;Everything is a weed until somebody calls it a flower,&rdquo; Suzanna says. Texture is also a way to create higher points in the arrangement.\n<br></p>\n<h3>Choose a color palette.</h3><br><p id=\"mf127\">\nBlush colors like pale pink and dusty peach are popular for spring, like peonies with cherry blossoms. If you are using a foliage base, decide if you want the focal flowers and foliage to be high contrast or if you prefer something softer. For example, if you go with light-colored flowers, a dark hunter green will provide more contrast than sage green.<br></p>\n\n<h3>Prep the flowers.</h3><br><p id=\"mf131\">\nAlways cut the stems on a hard diagonal two inches from the bottom, &ldquo;almost like dancing toes at the bottom of the vase,&rdquo; says Cameron. The flowers themselves should sit snugly into the container—what O&rsquo;Sullivan calls a &ldquo;domed effect&rdquo;—so they&rsquo;re not falling out. &ldquo;Most people don&rsquo;t cut their stems short enough,&rdquo; she says. And Cameron recommends putting some sugar in the water, which will help flowers bloom quicker. Other important tips: add cool tap water and trip stems every day, and don&rsquo;t put them in direct sunlight—even if you think they look pretty by the window.\n</p>","definition":"","author":"55a4306dca73a04c7c000001","category":["55a40b1628f55fe329000029"]}
