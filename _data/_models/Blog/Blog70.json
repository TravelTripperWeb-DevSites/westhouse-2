From Halloween through St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, the city manages to throw a great party in the streets almost every month of the year. The most popular parade, of course, is televised across the country and has become an iconic staple of the holiday for millions of people: the Thanksgiving Day Parade.</p>\n<p>Most of us know the parade from Al Roker&rsquo;s point of view, but attending it in person is an entirely different beast. The 2.8 mile stretch of floats, balloons and performers can surprise, shock, and delight every onlooker from the ages of 1 to 92.</p>\n<p>To get a sense of what the front-row action is really like, we asked our staff to share their favorite memories of past parades:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Mae, <em>Front Desk&nbsp;</em></h4>\n<p>&ldquo;I was a HUGE Hillary Duff fan back in the early 2000&rsquo;s. I convinced my parents to let me go to the parade in 2005 so I could see her perform on top of that diner float. Essentially, an eighteen year old&rsquo;s dream. I had to wake up really early in the morning and travel for three hours on a bus just to get there, so by the time I got back home I had missed the big meal. I told my family it wasn&rsquo;t the same without them and that I wouldn&rsquo;t do it again next year, but really, it was 100% worth it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Jason, <em>Catering Manager</em></h4>\n<p>&ldquo;A couple of years back a friend of mine signed up to be a balloon handler (don&rsquo;t ask me why), so a few of us went to show our support. This was my first time at the parade, and the balloons were really enormous, even bigger than I had remembered seeing them on TV. Each balloon needed like thirty people just to carry it. It was a really cold morning, and when my friend and his group marched past on 32nd street, this big gush of wind came in and made their balloon sway so low to the ground, it nearly knocked them over! The funny part was how no one else around us even noticed. With so much going on, the crowd completely missed the &lsquo;Yes, Virginia!&rsquo; balloon&rsquo;s nosedive into its handlers. Our friend still calls it one of the scariest moments of his life.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Rodil, <em>Bartender&nbsp;</em></h4>\n<p>&ldquo;Kanye West. Hands down. I&rsquo;m not really into parades, but when my girlfriend at the time mentioned that Kanye would be there, I made her wake up extra early with me so we could get a good view. I&rsquo;ll never forget it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Marcus, <em>Concierge&nbsp;</em></h4>\n<p>&ldquo;Seeing the cast of Cirque Du Soleil perform on a moving float was pretty epic. I thought they&rsquo;d tone it down for the float, but they still did backflips and jumps and flew around on trapezes like they were on stage. Everyone in the crowd kept gasping for air at the same time. Except a couple of the smaller kids that were fist pumping and cheering them on. Actually, watching the kids watch a moving Cirque Du Soleil was probably the most memorable part.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Elaine, <em>Night Manager&nbsp;</em></h4>\n<p>&ldquo;I was very young when my family and I went to the parade, and all I could talk about was Santa. I remember pestering my parents in the car ride down about when we were going to see the Santa float. <em>Would the reindeer be there? Would Mrs. Claus?</em> Oh man, I loved Mrs. Claus. When we finally got to the parade and Santa and his float passed by, I snapped. I told my parents there was no way that guy was the real Santa. He didn&rsquo;t even look like him! I guess that&rsquo;s when the Santa bubble burst for me.&rdquo;</p>"
