You practice, practice, practice. But when you&rsquo;re #InResidence, all it takes to get to the esteemed concert hall is a quick walk up 7th Avenue. Highlights of the 2017-18 season include pianist Daniil Trifonov, violinist Janine Jansen, and composer Philip Glass.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alvinailey.org/\">ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER</a></p>\n<p>See <strong>Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater&rsquo;s</strong> new works before they debut around the globe.
