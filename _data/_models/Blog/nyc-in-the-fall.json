The reds and yellows of the leaves, set against the Manhattan skyline and a crisp blue sky make this one of the most beautiful (read: Instagrammable) times of year.</li>\n<li><strong>Ordering off fall menus at restaurants.</strong> Acorn and butternut squashes are back on the table, and apple crisps and cobblers are sweetening dessert menus.
