And when it comes to dating in New York, the options are endless. Live theatre, lush greenspaces, Michelin-starred restaurants &mdash; where to begin? Jason, our Food &amp; Beverage Manager shares his favorite date spots in Midtown Manhattan for inspiration. Remember these for your next night out!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Q: What&rsquo;s your idea of the perfect New York City date?</h4>\n<p>A: You can&rsquo;t go wrong with a museum date. It&rsquo;s active, engaging, and gives you plenty to talk about. There are so many museums in New York, but I recommend the <a href=\"https://www.amnh.org/\">American Museum of Natural History</a>. They always have great exhibits. Plus, if the date goes well and you&rsquo;re feeling romantic, you can stargaze at the Hayden Planetarium!</p>\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\n<h4>Q: Central Park is another classic New York City date destination. Any off-the-beaten-path activities you recommend?</h4>\n<p>A: The <a href=\"https://centralparkzoo.com/\">Central Park Zoo</a> is a fun date spot, especially if you&rsquo;re planning a daytime date. It sets a charming tone for the day. It&rsquo;s pretty wild when you stop and think that there are monkeys, leopards, and penguins just a few blocks away at all times in Central Park! Try to be there for the sea lion feedings, which happen at 11:30 am, 1:30 pm, and 3:30 pm.</p>\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\n<h4>Q: Any recommendations for a spontaneous date?</h4>\n<p>A: If you&rsquo;re planning a date in a New York minute, turn to performance art. It&rsquo;s easy to snag affordable seats to a Broadway show from the <a href=\"https://www.tdf.org/nyc/7/TKTS-ticket-booths\">TKTS booth</a> in Times Square or Lincoln Center. You can get same-day tickets for up to 50% off for dozens of shows, including &ldquo;Cats,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hamilton,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dear Evan Hansen.&rdquo; Part of the fun is seeing what tickets you can get!</p>\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\n<h4>Q: What are your favorite date spots to grab a drink or a bite?</h4>\n<p>A: When most people think of a food date, they picture dinner and drinks. But for something more unexpected, why not plan a wine and dessert date? I love the Mini Ice Cream Sammies and the Frozen Drunken Grasshopper at <a href=\"https://www.casellulahk.com/\">Casellula</a>, a cozy wine bar in Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen. The servers are very friendly and will gladly help you pick the perfect bottle of red, white, or ros&eacute; to pair with your sweets.</p>\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\n<h4>Q: Any adventurous date recommendations?</h4>\n<p>A: Take a boat ride! <a href=\"https://hudsonsnyc.com/dining-experiences/\">Hudson&rsquo;s at Pier 81</a> has many different sailing packages to choose from. You can take a sunset dinner cruise, a Sunday morning brunch cruise, an open bar cruise &mdash; whatever you and your date are up for. It&rsquo;s hard to beat good food and spectacular city views on the water.</p>"
