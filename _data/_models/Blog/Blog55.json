The city offers a never-ending list of cuisines, menus, and food trends to try, and Tyann is on a mission to try every last dish the five boroughs have to offer. She&rsquo;s a foodie through and through and always has the best recommendations of where to grab a quick bite, where to meet someone for a first date, and where to make a reservation for a group dinner. Here, Tyann shares her itinerary of a perfect day spent eating in New York.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>BREAKFAST AT <a href=\"https://www.twohandsnyc.com/cafe/\">TWO HANDS CAFE</a></h4>\n<p>Everything on the menu at Two Hands Cafe is incredible, but my go-to is the Acai Bowl. It&rsquo;s the best tasting (and best looking) bowl in the city. It&rsquo;s packed with fruit and perfectly lined with delicious toppings like granola, coconut, cacao nibs, hemp, and chia seeds. The presentation is so impressive, I take a picture every time!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>LUNCH AT <a href=\"https://dimesnyc.com/\">DIMES</a></h4>\n<p>My ideal lunch is something light yet filling, and the Veggie Burger at Dimes is just that. It has avocado hummus, mustard greens, and harissa tofu mayo pickled wax beans. If I could eat one burger for the rest of my life, this would be it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>AFTERNOON SNACK AT <a href=\"https://www.chobani.com/chobani-cafe\">CHOBANI CAFE</a></h4>\n<p>Did you know that Chobani has cafes downtown? They serve everything from breakfast bowls to salads to dessert. I like to stop by in the afternoon. If I&rsquo;m craving something sweet, I&rsquo;ll get the Pistachio + Dark Chocolate bowl. If I&rsquo;m in the mood for something more savory, I&rsquo;ll get the Hummus + Za&rsquo;atar bowl. It&rsquo;s much healthier, not to mention more fresh, than grabbing something packaged at the market.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>HAPPY HOUR AT <a href=\"https://www.donnabklyn.com/\">DONNA</a></h4>\n<p>For a change of pace and scenery, I head to Donna in Williamsburg, Brooklyn for drinks. It&rsquo;s just across the bridge and has an impressive list of inventive craft cocktails. The vibe is low-key yet intimate. What&rsquo;s not to love about sipping a creative cocktail surrounded by houseplants?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>DINNER AT <a href=\"https://mapeche.momofuku.com/\">MOMOFUKU M&Aacute; P&Ecirc;CHE</a></h4>\n<p>M&aacute; P&ecirc;che is the only Momofuku restaurant in Midtown, meaning you can enjoy the gourmet experience and trendy atmosphere associated with the brand without the crowds or the long wait. It&rsquo;s the perfect restaurant for groups that like to order a bunch of shared dishes for the table and try a taste of everything. The M&aacute; P&ecirc;che menu changes seasonally, but there are a few tried and true dishes that are always available, like the Habanero Fried Chicken. Get an order for the table (or for yourself) &mdash; you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>DESSERT AT <a href=\"https://www.levainbakery.com/\">LEVAIN BAKERY</a></h4>\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t get any more classic than the chocolate chip cookie, and it doesn&rsquo;t get any better than the one from Levain Bakery. Their Chocolate Chip Walnut Cookie is legendary, and has been widely considered the best in the bakery business for over 20 years. In addition to cookies, Levain also has other treats like scones, muffins, and sticky buns. And yes, they&rsquo;re just as delicious.</p>"
