The East River Ferry, which connects Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens to each other, makes for a relaxing way to explore new neighborhoods and enjoy unbeatable skyline views. Here&rsquo;s a foodie-friendly guide to exploring New York via the East River Ferry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Wall Street/Pier 11</h2>\n<h3>Manhattan</h3>\n<p>Photo courtesy of @watermarkny</p>\n<p>There aren&rsquo;t many places in Manhattan where you can get a drink right on the water, but South Street Seaport is one of them. Take in the East River views at Watermark Bar, an open-air cocktail spot on South Street. The drink menu is standard&mdash;classic cocktails like the Dark &amp; Stormy ($12), $13 margaritas and an appropriately-named East River Martini ($14)&mdash;but the views can&rsquo;t be beat.</p>\n<p>Watermark Bar: 78 South St., 212-742-8200</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Brooklyn Bridge Park/Dumbo</h2>\n<h3>Brooklyn</h3>\n<p>Photo courtesy of @jacquestorres</p>\n<p>DUMBO isn&rsquo;t served by the NYC subway, so the East River Ferry is the best way to reach the historic area. Wander the neighborhood&rsquo;s cobbled streets, lined with galleries and shops like Powerhouse Arena&mdash;an art-focused bookstore. Sample sweets at Jacques Torres Chocolate, a European-style shop featuring the namesake chef&rsquo;s chocolates, or get a hand-made scoop from the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory. Grimaldi&rsquo;s Pizza, with its 100-year history of making coal-fired, brick-oven pies ($14) is a NYC must. Make a reservation at The River Caf&eacute; with pinch-worthy views back to Manhattan. For special occasions, splurge on the chef&rsquo;s signature tasting menu ($155 for six courses).</p>\n<p>Powerhouse Arena: 37 Main St., Brooklyn, 718-666-3049</p>\n<p>Jacques Torres Chocolate: 66 Water St., Brooklyn, 718-875-1269</p>\n<p>Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory: Atlantic Highlands, Pier 11, Brooklyn, 718-246-3963</p>\n<p>Grimaldi's Pizza: 1 Front St., Brooklyn, 718-858-4300 The River Caf&eacute;: 1 Water St., Brooklyn, 718-522-520</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Schaefer Landing/South Williamsburg</h2>\n<h3>Brooklyn</h3>\n<p>Photo courtesy of @maisonpremiere</p>\n<p>Just two decades ago, South Williamsburg was a haven for artists seeking cheap rents. Now, it&rsquo;s one of the hottest neighborhoods in the city. Sample the brunch at the retro-chic Diner, where the menu changes daily. It&rsquo;s been around since 1999, but the crowd that rolls up is more well-heeled than ever. Maison Premiere draws a similar set for its oysters (from $2.35), cocktails (from $12), served either at the U-shaped marble bar or in the back garden. Peter Luger Steak House, meanwhile, has watched over the neighborhood since the 1880s, serving some of the city&rsquo;s best steak all the while. Nearby Semilla is a vegetable-forward, 18-seat restaurant with an $85 set menu.</p>\n<p>Diner: 85 Broadway, Brooklyn, 718-586-3077</p>\n<p>Maison Premiere: 298 Bedford Ave., Brooklyn, 347-335-0446</p>\n<p>Peter Luger Steak House: 178 Broadway, Brooklyn, 718-387-7400 Semilla: 160 Havemeyer St., Brooklyn, 718-782-3474</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>North 6th St/North Williamsburg</h2>\n<h3>Brooklyn</h3>\n<p>Photo courtesy of @jooinnyc</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s even more to see and do in North Williamsburg. Fette Sau is a popular dry-rub joint serving the (Zagat-certified) best barbecue in New York. Nearby, Nitehawk Cinema serves craft cocktails and multi-course dinners to moviegoers as they watch first-run or classic films. Top off a visit to the neighborhood with a treat from Momofuku Milk Bar. The popular dessert spot from pastry chef and Masterchef host Christina Tosi is famous for its oat-crusted, butter-y &ldquo;Crack Pie,&rdquo; and and cereal milk soft-serve ice cream.</p>\n<p>Fette Sau: 354 Metropolitan Ave., Brooklyn, 718-963-3404</p>\n<p>Nitehawk Cinema: 136 Metropolitan Ave., Brooklyn, 718-782-8370</p>\n<p>Momofuku Milk Bar: 382 Metropolitan Ave., Brooklyn, 347-577-9504</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>India Street/Greenpoint</h2>\n<h3>Brooklyn</h3>\n<p>Photo courtesy of @lobsterjoint</p>\n<p>Like DUMBO, restaurant-filled Greenpoint is hard to reach by subway, so arriving on the East River Ferry is the way to go. Try the Greenpointer pizza ($15) at Paulie Gee&rsquo;s with fresh mozzarella, baby arugula, olive oil, fresh lemon juice and Parmigiano Reggiano. There&rsquo;s almost always a wait&mdash;but it&rsquo;s worth it. After, head to upscale Ramona on Franklin Avenue for a classic Sazerac ($11). Budin, the Nordic-inspired coffee bar, serves Dansk Mjod Klapojster by the glass ($8). Head further east to Manhattan Avenue for a more laid-back experience. Lobster rolls ($21), oysters ($2.95 each) and cocktails ($8) are on the menu at Lobster Joint, and can be enjoyed in its beach-themed backyard, while Troost is a neighborhood-favorite coffee shop that turns into a hip, low-key bar at night.</p>\n<p>Paulie Gee&rsquo;s: 60 Greenpoint Ave., Brooklyn, 347-987-3747</p>\n<p>Ramona: 113 Franklin St., Brooklyn, 347-227-8164</p>\n<p>Budin: 114 Greenpoint Ave., Brooklyn, 347-844-9639</p>\n<p>Lobster Joint: 1073 Manhattan Ave., Brooklyn, 718-389-8990</p>\n<p>Troost: 1011 Manhattan Ave., Brooklyn, 347-889-6761</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hunters Point South/Long Island City</h2>\n<h3>Queens</h3>\n<p>Photo courtesy of @momaps1</p>\n<p>Arrive in Long Island City and head to Gantry Plaza State Park&mdash;the neighborhood&rsquo;s waterfront park that offers sweeping Manhattan skyline views. Not far from the ferry, MoMA PS1 is celebrating its 40th anniversary with multiple exhibitions, including a survey of American artist Vito Acconci (till September 18), and &ldquo;Forty,&rdquo; a retrospective look at the artists who took part in the groundbreaking museum&rsquo;s earliest years.
