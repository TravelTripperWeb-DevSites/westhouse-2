It&rsquo;s time to shake up your after-work routine with an ode to vintage Hollywood. Make plans to join us every Thursday evening for cocktails, light fare, and a dash of glitz and glamour at SilverScreen at WestHouse, a weekly film series honoring the classic movies of yesteryear.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spend a motion picture-perfect night in <a href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/westhouse-hotel-new-york-dining/the-den/\">The Den</a>, our lounge with an intimate speakeasy atmosphere. Crystal chandeliers, leather couches, and deep mahogany wood accents invite you to sit back, relax, and enjoy a New York moment, cocktail in hand. Every Thursday evening, our sleek Manhattan style meets timeless Hollywood glamour.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>SilverScreen at WestHouse has quickly become a staple of the New York social scene. It&rsquo;s a weekly opportunity to see and be seen with the city&rsquo;s in-crowd. In addition to screening classic films, our expert bartenders create signature cocktails unique to each evening. As the movie plays with subtitles, guests are invited to sit and watch, or mingle with fellow film buffs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Last month we paid tribute to vintage Hollywood and silent film star Charlie Chaplin. Laughter filled The Den as we screened <em>A King in New York, A City of Lights, The Gold Rush, and Modern Times</em>. Our bartenders rose to the occasion with a Prohibition-era Mary Pickford, our refreshing signature City Lite, a sweet Lita Grey, and our rich signature The Millionaire.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Previously, we honored 007 himself by screening <em>Casino Royale, Octopussy, For Your Eyes Only, and Dr. No</em>. In true James Bond fashion our bartenders whipped up fine craft cocktails, including a Grey Goose Cosmo, a Knob Creek Manhattan, a Bulldog Gin Martini, and a Stoli Vodka Elit Martini &mdash; shaken, not stirred, of course.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gather your friends to sip, salute, and celebrate an era of bygone glamour. SilverScreen at WestHouse honors the Golden Age of Hollywood every Thursday evening at 6 pm in The Den!</p>",
