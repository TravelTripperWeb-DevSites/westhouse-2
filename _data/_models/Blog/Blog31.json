But even the busiest schedule allows you some downtime to see the best of New York. Here are five ways to explore the city while making the most of your day.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>1. Discover Pieces of Old New York</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/92_368_1128/media/2017-02-01-074457/1.subway-final-stop-Brooklyn-Bridge_CityHall-curbedny.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Though the city has evolved with the times, there are still artifacts of old New York hidden in plain sight. If you&rsquo;re downtown, ride the 6 train line to the final stop, Brooklyn Bridge/City Hall, and stay on the train as it turns around to discover one of the city&rsquo;s most beautiful but forgotten subway stations. In Midtown, see if you can spot the three intricate medallions, created by mosaicist Hildreth Mei&egrave;re, that adorn <a href=\"mailto:http://www.radiocity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Radio City Music Hall</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>2. Shop in SoHo</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/92_368_1128/media/2017-02-01-074713/2.Soho-Shopping.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s nothing like shopping in downtown New York. Here, the world&rsquo;s finest designers are all at your fingertips &mdash; and all within reach, if your time is limited. Luxury labels like Odin, A.P.C., and Thom Browne will refresh your wardrobe and meet your shopping needs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>3.
