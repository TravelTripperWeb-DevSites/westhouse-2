From music festivals to mini golf to movie nights, there&rsquo;s always something new and exciting to do, and no two days are alike. It&rsquo;s designed for New Yorkers of all ages, and the perfect place to spend the day as a family. One of Randall&rsquo;s Island&rsquo;s most popular events is Frieze New York, a contemporary art fair that takes place each May. Book a stay with us now and you&rsquo;ll receive two complimentary one-day tickets to the event.</p>\n<p><img id=\"1493719809791\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/92_368_2778/media/2017-05-02-060718/roosvelt.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Nestled between Manhattan&rsquo;s Upper East Side and Queens&rsquo; Astoria is Roosevelt Island, a narrow but booming section of the city. Formerly populated by hospitals and research centers, signs of Roosevelt Island&rsquo;s past still abound and attract visitors: Popular landmarks include the Octagon, the Blackwell House, the Strecker Laboratory, and the ruins of the ivy-covered Smallpox Hospital.</p>\n<p><img id=\"1493719833671\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/92_368_2778/media/2017-05-02-060716/governers.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Governors Island sits just a few hundred yards off the tip of lower Manhattan, but offers a lush, quiet escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. A former military post, US Army command headquarters, and US Coast Guard Complex, Governors Island is a crucial landmark of US history. Visitors are invited to explore the island, visit the exhibits at Fort Jay and Castle Williams, and see unparalleled views of the harbor and the city skyline.</p>\n<p><img id=\"1493719885720\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/92_368_2778/media/2017-05-02-060717/liberty.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For a culturally rich and fulfilling afternoon, make your way to Liberty Island and take in panoramic views of the city from the Statue of Liberty&rsquo;s pedestal and crown. Save enough time to visit the historically significant Immigration Museum on Ellis Island, where you&rsquo;ll discover the rich history of immigration in the late 19th century and hear the unique stories of pioneers who paved the way for their descendants.</p>",
