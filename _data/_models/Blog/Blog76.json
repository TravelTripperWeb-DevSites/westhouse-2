  "contents": "<p>New York is one of the most diverse cities in the world. International travellers have a good chance of stumbling upon familiar sights, sounds and flavors from back home, while residents benefit from the multicultural offerings hidden in every borough.</p>\n<p>Recent history has enabled this growing diversity of experience, encouraging every visitor and local to step outside of their comfort zones. From dancing to cuban music, watching a Norwegian film, or enjoying a p&atilde;o de queijo in Little Brazil, the possibilities for discovery are endless.</p>\n<h4>A Little History</h4>\n<p>New York has earned its proud &lsquo;melting-pot&rsquo; status by embracing new communities of immigrants for over a century. In fact, New York has always had larger percentage of immigrants as part of its total population than the United States as a whole.</p>\n<p>Two factors have made the city ideal for re-settlement: size and location. As the largest city on the Atlantic Coast, New York has been well-positioned to receive migrants from Europe and West Africa, as well as the rest of the world. And with five boroughs of thriving communities to choose from, finding the right fit has rarely proved difficult for new settlers.</p>\n<p>Each borough has its own unique settlement history. The Irish settlers that came during the Irish Potato Famine of the 1840&rsquo;s largely settled in Manhattan, while German, Jewish and Italian immigrants of the early 20th century scattered across all of the five boroughs. Brooklyn and the Bronx were the popular destinations for African-American settlers, contributing to the Harlem Renaissance of art, literature and music in the early 1920&rsquo;s. Asian migrants favored Queens, while the Bronx was the most popular destination for Hispanic communities.</p>\n<p>Over the past one hundred years, the city&rsquo;s total population has more than doubled, making it one of the most populous and most diverse cities on the map.</p>\n<h4>How to Have an International Day in New York</h4>\n<p>Experiencing the best of New York&rsquo;s cultural melange is difficult to do in just one day. Here&rsquo;s how the experts at WestHouse recommend you spend your International Day in the five boroughs:</p>\n<h4>Wake up in Damascus</h4>\n<p>Start your morning in Brooklyn with breakfast from the <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/damascus-bread-and-pastry-shop-brooklyn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Damascus Bread &amp; Pastry Shop</a>, where you can find Syrian, Turkish and Middle Eastern pastries like pistachio or date mammouls, baklava and spinach and feta pies.</p>\n<h4>Dive into Downtown&rsquo;s History</h4>\n<p>After breakfast, take the train into lower Manhattan to visit some of the best museums chronicling the city&rsquo;s diverse history.
