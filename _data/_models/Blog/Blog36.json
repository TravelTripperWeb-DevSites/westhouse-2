As the Frank Sinatra song goes: &ldquo;New York is the city that doesn&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo; But amidst the hustle and bustle, there are still ways to find peace and quiet. The next time you need to clear your head or get some fresh air, remember one of these hidden Midtown parks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://ahn15.com/tudorcitygreens/home.asphttp://ahn15.com/tudorcitygreens/home.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Tudor City Greens</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/92_368_1750/media/2017-02-28-025711/tudor-city-greens.jpg\" /></strong></p>\n<p>Step into nature without leaving the neighborhood. Tudor City Greens is a beautiful, elevated oasis that magically drowns out the sounds of 42nd Street. It&rsquo;s the perfect place to enjoy a quiet lunch, meditate, or collect your thoughts. 1 Tudor City Pl.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.cultivatehkny.org/alicesgarden\" target=\"_blank\">Alice&rsquo;s Garden</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><img style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/92_368_1750/media/2017-02-28-025706/alices-garden.jpg\" /></strong></p>\n<p>Behind an unassuming fence above the Lincoln Tunnel sits a beautiful green garden. Visitors can relax in the common areas and see what community members are planting in their plots. Named for the garden&rsquo;s late caretaker, Alice Parsekian, the community has maintained the land in her memory. 460 W 34th St.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://tclf.org/landscapes/paley-park\" target=\"_blank\">Paley Park</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/92_368_1750/media/2017-02-28-025709/paley-park.jpg\" /></strong></p>\n<p>You never know what you&rsquo;ll see next in Manhattan &mdash; including a waterfall in Midtown. Blink or you&rsquo;ll miss this cascading wall, quietly tucked away in the heart of the city. Paley Park isn&rsquo;t a traditional green park, but it is a nice, calming place to stop and reflect. 3 E 53rd St.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.sasaki.com/project/111/greenacre-park/\" target=\"_blank\">Greenacre Park</a></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/92_368_1750/media/2017-02-28-025707/greenacre-park.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Speaking of waterfalls in Midtown, there&rsquo;s another one just a few blocks away from Paley Park. Greenacre Park, hidden between tall skyscrapers, offers the perks of Paley Park with a bit more privacy and greenery. Just sit back, relax, and let the sounds of the city fade away. 217 E 51st St.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/sutton-place-park\" target=\"_blank\">Sutton Place Park</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/92_368_1750/media/2017-02-28-025710/sutton-park.jpg\" /></strong></p>\n<p>Lovely by both day and night, Sutton Place Park is ideal for reading, walking your dog, and taking in the spectacular view of the Queensboro Bridge. Here, you can have a true Manhattan moment &mdash; the movie&rsquo;s famous bridge scene between Woody Allen and Diane Keaton was filmed on this very spot. Sutton Pl. South.</p>",
