To immerse fairgoers with a multi-sensory experience, the New York- and Bangkok-based artist is installing a series of high-tech massage chairs upholstered in his signature bleached denim throughout the fair.\n<br></p>\n<h3>DRAPE YOURSELF IN ART</h3><br><p id=\"mf118\">Art and fashion are synonymous: Artist Pia Camil will hand out patchwork-fabric clothing for visitors to wear. Camil says her capes, flags and banners are &ldquo;habitable paintings,&rdquo; and can be worn as a robe or poncho, or even used as a picnic blanket.\n\n</p><h3>TAKE A PERSONALITY TEST</h3><br><p id=\"mf121\">\nIs it possible to discover your true personality by finding your way through a maze? Japanese artist Aki Sasamoto, who lives and works in NYC, has constructed a 3D maze that acts as a personality test. Wander through the series of doors, rooms and objects, and you just might find out more about yourself.\n\n</p><h3>DISCUSS BOUNDARY-PUSHING ART WITH <i>NY MAGAZINE </i>CRITIC JERRY SALTZ</h3><p id=\"mf124\">\n\nWhen <i>New York Magazine</i> critic Jerry Saltz was kicked off Facebook this year, it stoked debate about the scope for satire in the art world. Saltz, who now has more than 150,000 followers across Twitter and Instagram, will answer all your burning questions at ‘Ask Jerry&rsquo; on Saturday, May 16 at noon.\n<br></p>\n<h3>EXPLORE THE FAIR&rsquo;S HIDDEN UNDERBELLY</h3><br><p id=\"mf129\">L.A.-based artist Samara Golden is fascinated with unveiling Frieze&rsquo;s hidden layers – physical, social and psychological. Through a secret underground chamber, her cool installation will reveal the underbelly of the event, turning fairgoers into archeologists.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.microspec.com/tix123/eTic.cfm?code=FNY2015\" id=\"mfa24\">Click here</a> to purchase tickets to this year&rsquo;s Frieze Art Fair.
