The city lights and buzzing energy set the stage for endless possibilities. Whether you&rsquo;re whisking someone away on a romantic getaway, enjoying a birthday weekend, or showering a bachelor or bachelorette with love, here are the best ways to make it a trip to remember.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Start with luxurious accommodations and our <a href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/offers/celebratory-package/\">Celebratory Package</a>.</h4>\n<p>For a truly memorable experience, book WestHouse&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/offers/celebratory-package/\">Celebratory Package</a> and toast the occasion in style. Upon your arrival to one of our luxurious guest rooms, you&rsquo;ll be met with a chilled bottle of champagne and delectable chocolate-covered treats. With this special deal, the celebration can last all night, because a complimentary late checkout at 2 pm is included.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Relax and unwind with a spa morning at <a href=\"http://floatinglotus.com/\">Floating Lotus</a>.</h4>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;re settled in, the exciting sights of the city await. But first, take a few minutes to rest and rejuvenate. At <a href=\"http://floatinglotus.com/\">Floating Lotus</a>, you can relax in every sense of the word: Try stress-relieving floatation therapy, find balance with Reiki, and spend 30 relaxing minutes in the Salt Cave.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Take city views to the next level with a <a href=\"https://www.libertyhelicopter.com/helicopter-tours.html\">Liberty Helicopter</a> tour.</h4>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t get us wrong &mdash; the views at Empire State Building, Top of the Rock, and One World Trade Center are breathtaking. But when you&rsquo;re celebrating something truly special, it&rsquo;s worth going all out. Helicopter tours have become quite popular in New York City; they offer exhilarating views of the city&rsquo;s busy streets and stunning skyline. We recommend <a href=\"https://www.libertyhelicopter.com/helicopter-tours.html\">Liberty Helicopter</a> for daily tours that are both picturesque and budget-friendly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Toast at the legendary <a href=\"https://rainbowroom.com/\">Rainbow Room</a>.</h4>\n<p>When New Yorkers plan a special occasion, there&rsquo;s one destination that stands out from the rest: the <a href=\"https://rainbowroom.com/\">Rainbow Room</a>. For decades, it&rsquo;s been revered as the ultimate place to indulge and celebrate. Sip bespoke cocktails, dine on classic American bistro fare, and watch the stars of today perform in Live! from the Rainbow Room. It all happens high in the sky on the 65th floor of Rockefeller Center.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>See where the night takes you.</h4>\n<p>Part of the magic of New York City is that anything is possible &mdash; and often, the unexpected happens. After dinner, you could make your way to a show in Lincoln Center. You could find yourself getting after dinner drinks at a swanky bar like The Campbell. Or maybe, you&rsquo;ll take a stroll and see what comes next. You never know what you&rsquo;ll find. Enjoy the celebration!</p>"
