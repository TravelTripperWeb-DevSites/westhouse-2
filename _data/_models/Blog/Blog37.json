The best place to get your daily dose of Vitamin D is in one of the many parks around the city. In <a href=\"http://www.centralparknyc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Central Park</a>, you can walk for an entire day and still not discover all of its hidden treasures. Every park has its advantages: Madison Square Park boasts a <a href=\"https://www.shakeshack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Shake Shack</a>, while <a href=\"http://www.bryantpark.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Bryant Park</a> has shopping and ice skating. Uptown, <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/visit/met-cloisters\" target=\"_blank\">The Cloisters</a> at Fort Tryon Park offers a quieter, more private escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/92_368_2159/media/2017-03-08-115006/daylight-saving-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re up for a longer walk and want to explore another one of New York&rsquo;s boroughs, head downtown to the Financial District and walk across the <a href=\"http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Brooklyn Bridge</a> into Brooklyn&rsquo;s DUMBO neighborhood. Just across the water you&rsquo;ll find the quaint <a href=\"http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Brooklyn Bridge Park</a> and the charming <a href=\"http://janescarousel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jane&rsquo;s Carousel</a>, both of which offer incredible skyline views of Manhattan.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/92_368_2159/media/2017-03-08-115008/daylight-saving-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can make your way to the Lower East Side and cross the <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/infrastructure/williamsburg-bridge.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Williamsburg Bridge</a> to discover charming Williamsburg hot spots. Have a cup of coffee at <a href=\"https://www.devocion.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Devocion</a>, try the popular square pizza at <a href=\"http://pizzalovesemily.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Emmy Squared</a>, and pick up a read at the independent bookstore <a href=\"http://www.spoonbillbooks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Spoonbill &amp; Sugartown Books</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Feeling extra adventurous? Hop on a Citi Bike and go for a ride! The <a href=\"http://eastsidegreenway.weebly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">East Side Greenway</a> follows a scenic route along the East River. On the other side of town, the West Side Greenway will take you along the picturesque Hudson River. Exploring New York by bicycle will completely change your perspective of the city, and allow you to easily access beloved but harder-to-reach green spaces like <a href=\"http://www.nycgo.com/venues/roosevelt-island\" target=\"_blank\">Roosevelt Island</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/wards-island-park\" target=\"_blank\">Wards Island Park</a>, and <a href=\"https://randallsisland.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Randall&rsquo;s Island Park</a>.</p>",
