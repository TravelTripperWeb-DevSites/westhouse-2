Located in the true heart of the city, its 843 acres of inspiring architecture and landscape design offer a quiet escape in a vibrant, dynamic atmosphere. There&rsquo;s always something new to do and see in Central Park; it&rsquo;s home to free SummerStage concerts in the summer, the New York City Marathon finish line in the fall, ice skating at Wollman Rink in the winter, and beautiful blooms come spring.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With so many paths and points of interest, it might be difficult to know where to start. WestHouse is ideally located just a few blocks from Central Park, so consider us the jumping off point for your self-guided walking tour. This route covers a few miles, so you might want to divide it up into multiple parts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Make your way to the southeast entrance at 59th St. &amp; 5th Ave. where you&rsquo;re immediately greeted by <a href=\"http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/pond.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/\">The Pond</a>, one of Central Park&rsquo;s seven man-made bodies of water. Though just a stone&rsquo;s throw from the bustling streets of Manhattan, the water&rsquo;s edge offers a welcome sense of calm. Continue on to <a href=\"http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/gapstow-bridge.html\">Gapstow Bridge</a>, which offers the first of many magnificent photo ops in the park.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re sightseeing with children, there are dozens of family-friendly activities along the east side of the park.
