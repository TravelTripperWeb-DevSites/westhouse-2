The next time you&rsquo;re in Midtown, visit these must-snap spots and give your Instagram followers something to swoon over.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>1. BETHESDA TERRACE</strong></p>\n<p><img id=\"1498560878985\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_368_4469/media/2017-06-23-033726/Untitled-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no end to the gorgeous sights you can discover in Central Park. One of our favorites, Bethesda Terrace, is hidden right in the heart of the park. The ceiling, stairs, and fountain are beautiful from every angle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2. GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL</strong><img id=\"1498203491269\" class=\" \" style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_368_4469/media/2017-06-23-033726/Untitled-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Every inch of the city&rsquo;s most bustling and beloved train station radiates the beauty of classic New York. From the elegant crystal chandeliers to the intricate ceiling delicately painted with the constellations of the night sky, it&rsquo;s no wonder Grand Central Terminal is one of the most Instagrammable places in Midtown.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>3. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART ROOFTOP GARDEN</strong><span style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\"><img id=\"1498207672011\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_368_4469/media/2017-06-23-044714/Untitled-3.jpg\" /></span></p>\n<p>Summer is rooftop season in New York, and there&rsquo;s no better place to take in sweeping views of Central Park than atop the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Honorable mention: The courtyard inside the museum is also quite photogenic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>4. BIBBLE AND SIP</strong><span style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\"><img id=\"1498207822481\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_368_4469/media/2017-06-23-044953/Untitled-1.jpg\" /></span></p>\n<p>When you start seeing alpacas, you&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;re in the right place. Bibble and Sip is an alpaca-themed caf&eacute; known for its French and Asian-inspired coffee drinks and desserts. We recommend a lavender latte and a matcha cream puff. Yum!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>5. THE FLATIRON BUILDING</strong><img id=\"1498207949474\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_368_4469/media/2017-06-23-045152/Untitled-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Even local New Yorkers stop and stare at this unique building in the city&rsquo;s skyline. The Flatiron Building is a must-photograph every time you see it, and we recommend capturing it straight on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>6. THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY</strong><img id=\"1498208084274\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_368_4469/media/2017-06-23-045409/Untitled-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s nearly impossible not to &ldquo;Like&rdquo; a photo taken at the main branch of the New York Public Library. Snap a selfie with the stone lions, capture the grandeur of the marble staircases, and head upstairs to see the newly-redesigned Rose Reading Room.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>7. TIMES SQUARE</strong><img id=\"1498208317378\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_368_4469/media/2017-06-23-045602/Untitled-4.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>New York is the city that never sleeps, and Times Square is its ever-beating heart. Day or night, there&rsquo;s always a spectacular scene to be found and an adventure to be had.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>8. THE ROOSEVELT ISLAND TRAM</strong><img id=\"1498208517018\" class=\" \" style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_368_4469/media/2017-06-23-050033/Untitled-5.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Sometimes, you have to get out of the city to truly appreciate its beauty. Hop on the Roosevelt Island Tram and in just four minutes, you&rsquo;ll be transported to the historic neighborhood. The photos you&rsquo;ll take on the way will be some of your best ever.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>9. ROCKEFELLER CENTER</strong><img id=\"1498208653243\" class=\" \" style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_368_4469/media/2017-06-23-050348/Untitled-6.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Rockefeller Center is popular on Instagram for a variety of reasons. Namely the bronze statue of Atlas welcoming you to the plaza. During the winter, merry visitors flock to take photos at the skating rink and in front of the city&rsquo;s largest Christmas tree. Year-round, you can make your way up to Top of the Rock for unparalleled, unobstructed panoramic city views.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>10. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING</strong><img id=\"1498208771444\" class=\" \" style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_368_4469/media/2017-06-23-050552/Untitled-7.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The Empire State Building is hands down the most Instagram-worthy place in Midtown. And with good reason: Day or night, rain or shine, it offers you the best and most iconic view of Manhattan.</p>",
