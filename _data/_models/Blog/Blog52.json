It&rsquo;s the best season to take in everything that New York has to offer. There&rsquo;s something exciting happening on every street and every avenue. And if you know where to look, many of these events are absolutely free. From outdoor movies to water sports, here are the best ways to enjoy NYC for $0 this summer.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.nycgovparks.org/events/film\">1. CATCH A FLICK UNDER THE STARS.</a></h4>\n<p>Movie lovers can find free outdoor film screenings happening just about every night of the week. They pop up in parks in every borough &mdash; and it costs nothing to attend! We recommend the <a href=\"http://bryantpark.org/programs/hbo-bryant-park-film-festival\">HBO Bryant Park Summer Film Festival</a> for classic films like <em>Wall Street</em> and <em>Dirty Dancing</em>, and <a href=\"https://www.hudsonriverpark.org/events/series/riverflicks-big-hit-wednesdays\">Hudson RiverFlicks</a> for more recent blockbusters like <em>Hidden Figures</em> and <em>La La Land</em>.</p>\n<h4>2. LISTEN TO FREE MUSIC.</h4>\n<p>In addition to free movie screenings, there are also many free concerts happening this summer. The annual <a href=\"http://www.centralpark.com/guide/activities/concerts/summerstage-festival.html\">SummerStage Festival</a> in Central Park hosts artists from every genre, including rock, jazz, Latin, and hip-hop. For more classical tunes, head to the <a href=\"http://www.msmnyc.edu/\">Manhattan School of Music</a>, where (most) events are free.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/activities/boating\">3. KAYAK AT BROOKLYN BRIDGE PARK.</a></h4>\n<p>Where can you see amazing, unobstructed views of lower Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty without the crowds? On the water, of course! Make your way to the Brooklyn Bridge Park Boathouse from June to August to rent kayaks for free on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"http://www.siferry.com/index.html\">4. RIDE THE STATEN ISLAND FERRY.</a></h4>\n<p>If you want to be on the water without the wait, head downtown and catch a free ride on the Staten Island Ferry. It&rsquo;s worth it for the views of the city&rsquo;s bridges and skyscrapers alone. Plus, it&rsquo;s a great way to see the Statue of Liberty without dedicating an entire day to it. The roundtrip journey only takes about an hour.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"http://www.amnh.org/our-research/hayden-planetarium/resources/manhattanhenge/\">5. SNAP A PHOTO DURING MANHATTANHENGE.</a></h4>\n<p>Twice a year, something truly magical happens in New York: the sunset aligns perfectly with the city&rsquo;s skyline and grid of streets. It&rsquo;s truly beautiful to witness, and on July 12th and 13th, it&rsquo;s happening again. You&rsquo;ll find the best Manhattanhenge vantage points at 14th, 23rd, 34th, 42nd, and 57th Streets.</p>"
