But this classic venue isn&rsquo;t resting on its laurels. As is standard practice in our metropolis-in-motion, New York City&rsquo;s performing arts scene is evolving to suit an audience with increasingly diverse tastes in entertainment.\n<br><br>\nThe city&rsquo;s spring calendar of events goes beyond chamber music and classical recitals to span an array of genres and media. From Kronos Quartet&rsquo;s 21st century take on traditional string music to Bjӧrk&rsquo;s acclaimed queen-of-quirk stage show to an assortment of family-focused acts, Carnegie Hall and other Midtown venues are expanding their range this spring. It was a tough task, but we distilled the city&rsquo;s spring performing arts calendar to feature a few of our favorites.\n<br><br>\nCarnegie Hall is only a brief one-block walk away from WestHouse Hotel.

New York City Center hosts several of the genre-shattering star&rsquo;s NYC appearances this March. The matinee shows will focus on material from the artist&rsquo;s new album, <i>Vulnicura</i>. Tickets are already tough to come by via standard channels. StubHub.com is the best place to find Bjӧrk tickets in NYC at this point.\n\n<h3>NYC Itinerary Extra - <i>Bjork at MoMA<br></i></h3>\n<br><br>If you&rsquo;re a Bjork fan in New York City this March, you&rsquo;re in luck. In addition to her set of shows at Carnegie Hall and City Center, the singer is the subject of a career-spanning retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. The exhibition includes instruments used on her <i>Biophilia</i> album, some of the singer&rsquo;s most famous visuals and costumes, and a presentation of the singer&rsquo;s groundbreaking music videos.\n<a href=\"http://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2015/3/7/1200/PM/Bjork/\" id=\"mfa23\">\nFind out more about Bjӧrk&rsquo;s upcoming shows in New York City</a>\n\n<h3>Meredith Monk &amp; Friends - March 22, 2015 + May 2, 2015<br><br></h3>\n<br>She&rsquo;s worked with luminaries as diverse as John Zorn and DJ Spooky, and Meredith Monk is coming to Carnegie Hall for an artist-in-residence series that crosses the boundaries of classical, pop and avant-garde. Local musicians, including nu-classical standouts Bang on a Can All-Stars, will accompany Monk at each of her Carnegie Hall appearances. On March 22, Monk and the ensemble will perform a remix-heavy set of Monk&rsquo;s most forward-thinking selections. Her return to the venue on May 2 will focus on classics from her five-decade career, performed alongside a vocal ensemble.\n<br>\n<h3>NYC Itinerary Extra - <i>Kajitsu</i></h3>\n<br><br>You can find world-class Tsukiji-sourced fish at many a Manhattan sushi joint. But those high-end spots don&rsquo;t necessarily best Kajitsu when it comes to encompassing the breadth of Japanese cuisine. The restaurant&rsquo;s tasting menu changes monthly, showcasing delicacies not often found stateside such as Takiawase: lotus roots, burdock roots, tofu, nameko mushrooms, carrot, mizuna green, and chickpea. Kajitsu&rsquo;s expansive menu mirrors Monk&rsquo;s catalog by paying respect to tradition with one foot planted firmly in the future.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.carnegiehall.org/monk/events/\" id=\"mfa24\">Learn more about Meredith Monk&rsquo;s upcoming appearances at Carnegie Hall</a>\n\n<h3>The Music of David Byrne &amp; Talking Heads - March 23, 2015</h3>\n<br><br>This benefit concert (for Music Education Programs Serving Underprivileged Youth) showcases the best songs of David Byrne and Talking Heads, performed by an array of popular musicians. The lineup includes a smorgasbord of styles and genres, with musicians such as CeeLo Green, Glen Hansard, Esperanza Spalding, Santigold, O.A.R., and many others.\n\n<h3>NYC Itinerary Extra - <i>Porchlight Bar</i></h3>\n<br><br>If you&rsquo;re the type who likes their concert lineups varied and their drink menus diverse, visit Porchlight after the David Byrne concert and enjoy Danny Meyer&rsquo;s newest dining destination. The new spirits-beer-wine-and-food emporium on the west side serves snacks like beef jerky and drinks covering a broad spectrum of price points: Think cans of Narragansett, fingers of Glenmorangie 18-year, and $9 glasses of Riesling. The bar&rsquo;s down-home, southern style doesn&rsquo;t have much in common with the new wave stylings of Talking Heads, but its expansive menu evokes Byrne&rsquo;s diverse discography.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2015/3/23/0800/PM/The-Music-of-David-Byrne-Talking-Heads/\" id=\"mfa25\">More information on the David Byrne &amp; Talking Heads benefit show at Carnegie Hall</a>\n<br>\n<h3>USA-Japan Goodwill Concert - April 6, 2015</h3>\n<br><br>Musicians from either side of the Pacific come together at Carnegie Hall in early April for a celebration of U.S.-Japanese relations and the countries&rsquo; shared musical heritage. Japanese choral groups such as the Goshiki Sakura Chorus and Kinboukai will perform alongside choral collections from Westchester, Baltimore, and Harrisburg —&nbsp;singing a mix of traditional Japanese music and pop music.\n\n<h3>NYC Itinerary Extra - <i>&ldquo;Discovering Japanese Art: American Collectors and the Met&rdquo; at the Metropolitan Museum of Art<br><br></i></h3>\nDive deeper into the art and culture of Japan —&nbsp;and its influence in modern America — by viewing the Metropolitan Museum of Art&rsquo;s vast collection of Japanese art. The museum&rsquo;s comprehensive collection includes 200 masterworks from a variety of media, ranging from 1880s decorative pieces to world-renowned &nbsp;paintings like <i>Great Wave</i> and <i>Morning Glories</i>. If you&rsquo;re looking for a place to relax between the exhibition and the concert, the Met&rsquo;s Japanese Tea Garden provides a calming respite from the bustle of the city.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2015/3/7/0900/PM/Kronos-Quartet/\" id=\"mfa26\">Learn more about the USA-Japan Goodwill Concert</a>\n\n<h3>Carnegie Kids: Songs for Unusual Creatures - May 17, 2015<br><br></h3><p style=\"\" id=\"mf157\">Carnegie Hall isn&rsquo;t all about buttoned-up classical music concerts and indie music showcases: the venue makes room on the calendar for kids, too -- or as we at WestHouse like to call them, &ldquo;<a href=\"/?p=345\" id=\"mfa27\">Little Residents</a></p>.&rdquo; This Sunday matinee musical event focuses on an array of bizarre beasts, including giant Chinese salamanders, elephant shrews, and other unique animals: all portrayed with fun — and dancing — in mind.\n<br>\n<h3>NYC Itinerary Extra - Carnegie Deli</h3>\n<br><br>This midtown diner offers a family-friendly taste of traditional NYC fare without requiring a trek to the outer boroughs. It&rsquo;s within walking distance of Carnegie Hall, it offers breakfast all day in true diner style, and its decor offers a virtual window into New York City&rsquo;s yesteryear. Enjoy a truly classic taste of New York City: a pastrami sandwich, piled high with enough meat to justify the $29.99 price tag.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2015/5/17/0200/PM/Carnegie-Kids-Songs-for-Unusual-Creatures/\" id=\"mfa28\">Learn more about the upcoming Carnegie Kids program</a>\n\n","definition":"","category":["55a40b1628f55fe329000029","55a40b1d28f55f08a900002b"]}
