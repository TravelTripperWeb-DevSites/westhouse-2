But in addition to the famous landmarks, there&rsquo;s another set of memorable places made famous through film. It&rsquo;s not every day you can dine in the same caf&eacute; as Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, or see the city through Woody Allen and Diane Keaton&rsquo;s eyes. These are some of the most famous NYC spots that have appeared on the big screen. Don&rsquo;t be shy; stop by and snap a photo!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><a title=\"Katz&rsquo;s Delicatessen\" href=\"https://www.katzsdelicatessen.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Katz&rsquo;s Delicatessen</a> from <em>When Harry Met Sally</em></h4>\n<p>Head downtown to Katz&rsquo;s Deli, where the most famous scene from <em>When Harry Met Sally</em> was filmed. Even if you don&rsquo;t get to sit in their exact booth (you&rsquo;ll know it from the sign that reads &ldquo;Where Harry met Sally&hellip;hope you have what she had!&rdquo;), you can still enjoy the mile-high pastrami sandwich, one of the city&rsquo;s most beloved meals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><a title=\"Caf&eacute; Lalo\" href=\"http://cafelalo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Caf&eacute; Lalo</a> from <em>You&rsquo;ve Got Mail</em></h4>\n<p>For dessert (and a little bit more Meg Ryan), head uptown to the Upper West Side&rsquo;s Caf&eacute; Lalo. The self-proclaimed &ldquo;most famous caf&eacute; in NYC&rdquo; is practically its own character in <em>You&rsquo;ve Got Mail</em>, serving as the location where Tom Hanks realizes Ryan is both his professional nemesis and internet love interest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>The Subway Grate from <em>The Seven Year Itch</em></h4>\n<p>Hiding in plain sight on the southwest corner of Lexington Avenue and 52nd Street sits the most famous subway grate in the world. It marks the spot where back in 1954, Marilyn Monroe&rsquo;s iconic ivory dress blew up, exposing her legs, as an uptown 6 train rushed by underground. There&rsquo;s no sign marking the exact location for the famous scene from <em>The Seven Year Itch</em>, but if you happen to walk by while a train passes, it&rsquo;s the perfect opportunity for your own mini movie star moment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><a title=\"Tiffany &amp; Co.\" href=\"https://www.tiffany.com/jewelry-stores/search?qs=t+10019&amp;tracksearchterm=10019#t+10019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tiffany &amp; Co.</a> from <em>Breakfast at Tiffany&rsquo;s</em></h4>\n<p>Fifth Avenue is one of New York City&rsquo;s most popular shopping destinations, featuring luxury labels like Louis Vuitton, Henri Bendel, Valentino, and more. Among the best of the best is Tiffany &amp; Co. But this isn&rsquo;t just any Tiffany&rsquo;s &mdash; it&rsquo;s the jewelry brand&rsquo;s flagship location, and it doubles as the place where Audrey Hepburn&rsquo;s Holly Golightly enjoys her morning coffee and pastry in <em>Breakfast at Tiffany&rsquo;s</em>. Make your way to 5th Avenue and 57th Street in the early hours of the morning to recreate the moment. Bonus points if you wear a little black dress, oversized sunglasses, and pearls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Hook &amp; Ladder 8 from <em>Ghostbusters</em></h4>\n<p>Believe it or not, the fire station from the <em>Ghostbusters</em> films is still active. But the FDNY knows the location means a lot to fans, and they keep the building well-maintained. At 14 North Moore Street down in Tribeca, it&rsquo;s a bit off the beaten path, but a must-see for &lsquo;80s movie lovers. Even if you can&rsquo;t make it inside, it&rsquo;s still worth it for the Ghostbusters street art decorating the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>The East River View from <em>Manhattan</em></h4>\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t get any more iconic than Woody Allen and Diane Keaton greeting the dawn from a park bench along the East River, the majestic Queensboro Bridge before them. You can recreate the memorable moment in Sutton Square, located at the very end of 58th Street on the east side of Midtown. There sits a park with benches and everything. The moment is so famous, it&rsquo;s even on the movie poster.</p>"
