But the famous show over the East River begins at 9:20pm and last about 30 minutes. With an entire day to fill before the fireworks begin, here&rsquo;s how to have the perfect summer day in New York on the 4th of July.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Rent a CitiBike.</h2>\n<p>New York&rsquo;s bike share program, CitiBike, is the best way to <a href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/blog/westgouses-guide-to-biking-the-hudson-river-greenway/\">explore some of the city&rsquo;s most famous attractions</a>. Ride your CitiBike down the Hudson River Greenway&mdash;the most popular bikeway in the United States&mdash;to the Whitney Museum of American Art, where you can take in the latest exhibits, before continuing on to Grand Banks, an oyster bar on a historic wooden schooner on the Hudson River in Tribeca.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whitney Museum of American Art: 99 Gansevoort St.</p>\n<p>Grand Banks: Pier 25, Hudson River Park</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Try the hot dog at DBGB.</h2>\n<p>There are plenty of places to get a hot dog in New York, but Chef Daniel Boulud&rsquo;s DBGB Dog gives all others a run for their money. The house-made beef wiener with saut&eacute;ed onion, mustard, ketchup, &ldquo;299&rdquo; relish, fris&eacute;e and radish ($10) is the perfect summer snack.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>DBGB Kitchen and Bar: 299 Bowery, 212-933-5300</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Beat the heat on a rooftop.</h2>\n<p>New York&rsquo;s rooftop bars and restaurants are coveted real estate during the summer months. For a breeze and a refreshing cocktail, head to Catch Roof in the Meatpacking District. In Flatiron, Eataly&rsquo;s rooftop beer garden, La Birreria, has been transformed for the summer into Sabbia, a pop-up beach lounge where you can enjoy Island Creek Oysters and local swordfish. And here in Midtown, WestHouse&rsquo;s Terrace offers a bird&rsquo;s eye view over the Concrete Jungle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Catch Roof: 21 9th Ave., 212-392-5978</p>\n<p>Sabbia: 200 Fifth Ave., 212-937-8910</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Soak up the sun in a NYC park.</h2>\n<p>Enjoy New York&rsquo;s many <a href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/blog/5-nyc-parks-where-you-can-dine-outside/\">green spaces that also offer great food</a>. Shake Shack in Madison Square Park has served their famous Shack burgers since 2004, while the Pavilion in Union Square offers a decidedly tropical feel with ceiling fans and potted palms. Further uptown, catch some rays at Boat Basin Caf&eacute; in Riverside Park, a casual open-air bar and restaurant that serves knockout barbecue on paper plates and cocktails in plastic cups.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Shake Shack: Madison Ave. at E. 23rd St., 646-747-2606</p>\n<p>The Pavilion: 20 Union Square W., 212-677-7818</p>\n<p>Boat Basin Caf&eacute;: W. 79th St., 212-496-5542</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>See the Macy&rsquo;s 4th of July Fireworks.</h2>\n<p>The fireworks are set off from barges near Pier 17, in Manhattan. In the city, South Street Seaport is a great place to catch the celebration down by the water. For a more direct view, head across the river to Brooklyn Bridge Park. Fornino, a trendy pizzeria with a rooftop patio directly on the riverfront is hosting an open bar dinner party during the fireworks. Nearby, Berry Park&rsquo;s rooftop bar in Greenpoint also offers great views of the Manhattan skyline.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fornino: Pier 6, Brooklyn Bridge Park, 718-422-1107</p>\n<p>Berry Park: 4 Berry St., Brooklyn, 718-782-2829</p>","image":{"url":"/assets/images/How-to-Celebrate-the-4th-of-July-in-NYC.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"url":"/assets/images/How-to-Celebrate-the-4th-of-July-in-NYC.jpg"}}
