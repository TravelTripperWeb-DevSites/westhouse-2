Last performed at the Met by Enrico Caruso in 1916, the three-part-opera tells the dramatic tale of two best friends who fall in love with the same woman. While few opera-goers will know most of its beautifully melodic score, most will recognize the famed &ldquo;Au fond du temple saint,&rdquo; Bizet&rsquo;s gorgeous duet which has become one of the opera world&rsquo;s most famous and oft-performed pieces. This production, stars tenor Matthew Polenzani and baritone Mariusz Kwiecien as the two pearl fishers pursuing Hindu priestess Le&iuml;la, played by soprano Diana Damrau. The New York Times hails the &ldquo;dream cast&rdquo; for its creating &ldquo;theatrical magic.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><br />For more information and tickets, visit the Metropolitan Opera website.</p>","definition":""}
