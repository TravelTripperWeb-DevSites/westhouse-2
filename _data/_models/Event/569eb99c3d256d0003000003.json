Comprised of 35 paintings and 50 other works on paper, the exhibition explores how Munch&rsquo;s use of color intensifies the subject matter&rsquo;s emotional power, and how artists in the early twentieth century used his paintings&mdash;which often explored dark themes such as alienation and vulnerability&mdash;as inspiration. The Neue Galerie is housed inside an Art Nouveau mansion overlooking Central Park on Fifth Avenue, and is one of New York&rsquo;s most intimate fine art experiences.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.755; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">For more information, visit the museum&rsquo;s website.</p>\n<p>Photo by Hulya Kolabas for Neue Galerie, via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BAu4SUCsM-e/?taken-by=neuegalerieny\">@neuegalerie</a>.</p>","definition":""}
