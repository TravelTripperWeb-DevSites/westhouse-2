Ten miles north of Midtown, the city&rsquo;s famous botanical garden dates back to 1891, and is a sprawling, 250-acre park, home to over a million living plants. Its orchid show has been a tradition since the early 2000s, and draws crowds as they escape the winter to see the tropical flower arranged in fantastical settings.</p>\n<p><br />For more information, visit the <a class=\"\" href=\"https://www.nybg.org/visit/exhibitions.php#TheOrchidShow\">NYBG website</a>. </p>","definition":""}
