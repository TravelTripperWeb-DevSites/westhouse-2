What started as a walk of just two pipe bands has grown into a grand assembly of hundreds of pipers and thousands of other marchers. The parade, which marks the culmination of Tartan Week&rsquo;s multitude of Scottish-pride events, heads up Sixth Avenue from Midtown to Central Park, and usually sees a famous Scot as Grand Marshall. Past examples include Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rsquo;s Kevin McKidd, Tony winner Alan Cumming and the great Sean Connery.</p><p><br>For more information, visit the <a href=\"https://nyctartanweek.org/\">NYC Tartan Week website</a>. <br></p>","definition":""}
