Go here for a subdued night out with great food from chef Todd Mitgang.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What to order</b>: Grilled prawns with baby leeks, spaghetti squash and a blackened garlic purée; crispy alligator for the derring-do types.

While the neighborhood has transformed in that time, Great Jones Café has remained steady, with oldies playing from a jukebox and the day&rsquo;s menu written on a chalkboard.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What to order</b>: The hambone gumbo, loaded with Andouille sausage and shrimp, and (not or!) the crispy Creole wings, which come slathered in a house-made hot sauce.

Even celebrities like Mary J. Blige and Rosario Dawson have taken part in the white-bib, blue-glove experience on the Lower East Side.</p><p><b>What to order</b>: The Boil keeps it simple: Pick your seafood, your sauce (Old Bay, garlic butter or lemon pepper) and your spice level. Go all out and order the Boil Special, which combines the three sauces into a delicious blend.

We love the back terrace too.</p><p><b>What to order</b>: The shrimp po&rsquo; boy, for its lightly toasted bun and perfectly cooked shrimp, and a sazerac for good measure. Ninth Ward sticks to tradition and pours the whisky-and-bitters cocktail into an absinthe-rinsed glass.

Three main contenders rise to the top: <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafemarie-new-york\">Cafemarie</a>, which opened in the West Village last June, serves the fried dough as a square topped with a heaping pile of confectioner&rsquo;s sugar. <a href=\"https://www.cheeky-sandwiches.com/\">Cheeky Sandwiches</a>, in the Lower East Side, wins over audiences with its smaller, round beignets, also served with a heavy dusting of powdered sugar (pictured above). Diners here love the writing on the wall, which toasts to &ldquo;the ducks who live in the swamp.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/rays-candy-store-new-york-2\">Ray&rsquo;s Candy Store</a>, a hole-in-the-wall ice cream joint in the East Village, is a local favorite because it doles out mini-mountains of both traditional and oreo-filled beignets, often with a side of ice cream. Celebrate Fat Tuesday right by trying all three spots. Photo by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/qPeg3sEnjt/?taken-by=skinny_fat_kid\">@skinny_fat_kid</a>. </p>",
