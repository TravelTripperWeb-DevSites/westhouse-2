The cherry trees, or Sakura, were a gift from the Japanese government that were originally meant to arrive in 1909 for the commemoration of the Henry-Hudson voyage. But those trees were lost at sea, and the cherry blossoms didn&rsquo;t make it to Manhattan grounds until three years later.</p>\n<p>Today, cherry blossoms can be found all over the city, including Grant&rsquo;s tomb, Riverside and Central Parks. Every year, new cherry blossoms are planted in honor of <a title=\"Japan Day\" href=\"http://www.japandaynyc.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Japan Day</a>, as well as to supplement the original gift from Japan one-hundred years ago.</p>\n<p>The celebration isn&rsquo;t just about the trees, though. As WestHouse insider Alicia puts it: &ldquo;Japan Day is a mashup of cultural celebrations. Basically, loads of music, food and art.&rdquo; Here are her highlights of the day&rsquo;s events:</p>\n<h3>Dancing the NY ONDO</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not one for dancing in public, but I love watching the Bon Odori each year. Created by Momo Suzuki, the founder of the Japanese Folk Dance Institute, this &lsquo;<em>Ondo</em>&rsquo; is based on the traditional Bon Odori dance, but with a New York twist. They have an English verse at the end and everyone is encouraged to join in.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3>Kabuki Face Painting</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;Face painting is a big hit with the kids, but I love seeing the adults get into it too. The designs are really beautiful, intricate and colorful. It&rsquo;s an awesome way to get yourself into the spirit of the day.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Calligraphy Tent</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;Japanese calligraphy isn&rsquo;t exactly easy to master, but they do a great job of teaching the style to kids and adults at the tent. I always get excited to experiment with those large calligraphy pens.</p>\n<h3>Food Tents</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;Unsurprisingly, the food at the festival is really, really good. You can watch demonstrations of the gyoza or okonomiyaki making, or just eat everything in sight (which is usually what I do).&rdquo;</p>"
