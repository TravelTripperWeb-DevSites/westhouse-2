  "contents": "<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Along with warmer weather&mdash;perfect for al fresco dining and outdoor activities&mdash;spring in New York also brings unpredictable weather. While a rainy day is never ideal, the city&rsquo;s best luxury shopping, acclaimed dining and noteworthy exhibitions can be enjoyed indoors, meaning unpleasant weather is no excuse for wasted time. Here&rsquo;s our guide for where to go this spring in New York City.</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong>See the New Degas Exhibition the Museum of Modern Art</strong></h2>\n<p>This spring, the MoMA is presenting <a class=\"\" href=\"https://moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1613?locale=en\">Edgar Degas: A Strange New Beauty</a>, a groundbreaking exhibition on the French artist&rsquo;s little-known print works. While Degas experimented with the new medium throughout the 1870s, his legacy has, until now, focused only on painting. After the special exhibition, don&rsquo;t miss the museum&rsquo;s permanent collection of nearly 200,000 works on display, including works like Van Gogh's &ldquo;Starry Night,&rdquo; Monet&rsquo;s Water Lilies and Dal&iacute;&rsquo;s &ldquo;Persistence of Memory.&rdquo; The MoMA also has an extensive film collection, showcasing regular screenings of international films. Check the <a class=\"\" href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/?happening_filter=Films\">MoMA film schedule</a> to see what&rsquo;s on.</p>\n<p><a class=\"\" href=\"https://www.moma.org\">MoMa</a>: 11 W. 53rd St., 212-708-9400</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Shop and dine at Time Warner Center</strong></h2>\n<p>Skepticism surrounded the 2004 opening of the Shops at Columbus Circle. Few believed the upscale mall could compete with established shopping districts, but 12 years later 40,000 shoppers pass through daily for Diptyque candles, Swedish cosmetics from Face Stockholm, and Tumi travel essentials. New this year is Sugar Factory, which quickly became one of <a class=\"\" href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/blog/nyc-best-candy-shop\">New York City&rsquo;s best candy shops</a>. There are several other luxury brands to visit (Coach, Michael Kors, Swarovski and the like), but save time for fine dining. The complex is also home to the Michelin 3-star Per Se and to Masa&mdash;a Japanese and sushi restaurant that&rsquo;s also the most expensive in the city. For a quick bite, head downstairs to the roomy caf&eacute; at Whole Foods.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a class=\"\" href=\"https://www.theshopsatcolumbuscircle.com/about/\">Time Warner Center</a>: 10 Columbus Cir., 212-823-6300</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Channel your inner Italian at Eataly</strong></h2>\n<p>If you have to be indoors, Eataly&rsquo;s 50,000-square-feet of restaurants, food counters and cooking classes is sure to keep you busy. The renowned Italian marketplace offers authentic pasta, gelato and espresso&mdash;the perfect ingredients for ignoring inclement weather New York and pretending like you&rsquo;re under the Tuscan sun. And this spring, downtown is getting its own outpost&mdash;nearly as large, at 40,000 square-feet&mdash;in 4 World Trade Center. Expect it to open in April.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a class=\"\" href=\"https://www.eataly.com/us_en/stores/new-york/\">Eataly</a>: 200 5th Ave., 212-229-2560</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Check the schedule at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts</strong></h2>\n<p>Rain or shine, there&rsquo;s always something going on at Lincoln Center. Home to the Metropolitan Opera, New York City Ballet and New York Philharmonic Orchestra, it serves as the city&rsquo;s cultural hub. Highlights this season include the opera&rsquo;s new production of Strauss's Elektra, George Balanchine&rsquo;s Jewels trifecta at the ballet and world premier from French composer Franck Krawczyk.</p>\n<p><a class=\"\" href=\"https://www.lincolncenter.org\">Lincoln Center</a>: 10 Lincoln Center Plz., 212-875-5456</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Get lost in Strand Bookstore</strong></h2>\n<p>Famously known to have 18 miles of new, used and rare books, Strand Bookstore offers refuge from the elements. Once you find a comfortable nook in this three-floor shop, it&rsquo;s easy to get lost in a book while the time flies by. If the rain continues, head just one block up to the Regal Cinemas in Union Square to stay dry while taking in one of the latest movies.</p>\n<p><a class=\"\" href=\"https://www.strandbooks.com\">Strand Bookstore</a>: 828 Broadway, 212-473-1452</p>",
