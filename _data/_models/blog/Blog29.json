  "contents": "<p>Are you a fan of Broadway? Then the coming weeks are a great time to be #InResidence at WestHouse, with the semi-annual Broadway Week promotion offering theatregoers a chance to purchase two-for-one tickets to a range of Broadway shows.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The winter edition, running January 17&ndash;February 5, 2017, includes crowd favorites like Tony winners Beautiful: The Carole King Musical, The Lion King and Kinky Boots, plus recent hits The Color Purple, Aladdin. Here are some favorites from your WestHouse team:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Waitress</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Featuring breathtaking music &amp; lyrics by Sara Bareilles, and playing only a few blocks from WestHouse, Waitress follows the story of Jenna (played by Jessie Mueller) who bakes amazing pies and is pregnant and trapped in her current situation, but looking for a happy ending. &nbsp;Based on the 2007 film by the late Adrienne Shelly, this new musical is uplifting and full of hope, and has fast become a guest favorite. As an added bonus, it&rsquo;s also one of the few musicals on Broadway with an all-female creative team!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Wicked&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard not to fall in love with the untold story of the Witches of Oz. The show is full of energy and has a wonderful backstory with all of the questions behind Oz&rsquo;s smallest details filled in. Why is the Wicked Witch green? When did the monkeys start flying? Just how long has Glinda been traveling by bubble? From a creative standpoint the sets and costumes dazzle and some fantastic songs including huge ballads such as Defying Gravity, to comical, quirky new favorites! Not to be missed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>On Your Feet!&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>This exhilarating new Broadway musical is based on the life and music of Emilio and Gloria Estefan. For them, Havana would always be home. But America - and music history - was their destiny. The songs are the star of this musical, allowing you to discover the remarkable true story of how they made their American dream come true featuring some of your favorite hit songs, including &ldquo;Conga,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rhythm Is Gonna Get You&rdquo; and &ldquo;Anything For You.&rdquo; As a recent guest commented on her return, prepare to be on your feet from start to finish!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Paramour</strong></p>\n<p>Not unlike the inspiration for WestHouse, this Cirque du Soleil show is themed to the glamorous \"Golden age of Hollywood\" and follows the life of a poet who is forced to choose between love and art. We love the glittering and stylized speakeasy and penthouse sets, extravagant costumes and memorable score. Happily, it also has those aerialists, acrobats, jugglers, and tumblers we love!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The Front Page</strong></p>\n<p>Starring Nathan Lane, John Slattery &amp; John Goodman, this limited 19 week run play is the &ldquo;5,000-volt&rdquo; Broadway revival of Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur&rsquo;s classic 1928 comedy that is set in the world of the Chicago newspaper business. See it to experience what Time Out New York called &ldquo;a hellacious comic frenzy by one of the best acting ensembles you and I may ever see.&rdquo; Indeed this ensemble of reporters sitting around a newsroom, chain-smoking cigarettes, playing poker and waiting for a hot story to come in is filled top to bottom with some of the best actors in this town, and all only minutes away at the historic Broadhurst Theatre!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More information on Broadway Week is available from our concierge team or at nycgo.com/broadway-week.&nbsp;</p>",
