Every spring, thousands of people gather downtown to see the best and brightest films, performances, and ideas from today&rsquo;s artists and innovators.</p>\n<p>This year&rsquo;s festival promises to be particularly unique, as nearly 46% of the selected films are directed by women - the first time ever in the festival&rsquo;s history that nearly half of the screenings hail from female directors.</p>\n<p>Given its strong showing of female artists and directors, it&rsquo;s clear that recent social and political movements are at the forefront of this year&rsquo;s theme. In a recent press release, programming director Cara Cusumano said: &ldquo;In a year that has reminded us more often of our divisions than our connections, this Festival's program embraces film&rsquo;s unique power to overcome differences &mdash; that connecting with stories not our own is the road into our deeply programmed human capacity for empathy and understanding. We hope that in representing a wealth of undiscovered stories and unique perspectives &mdash; including those of a record number of female directors &mdash; these 96 films offer a collective journey towards narrower divides and smaller obstacles.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re in town and looking to catch some of these spectacular stories and events, here are our picks for experiencing the best of this year&rsquo;s immersive program.</p>\n<h4>Narrative Films</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Zoe</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This year&rsquo;s centerpiece starring L&eacute;a Seydoux, Ewan McGregor, Christina Aguilera, and Rashida Jones is a futuristic love story set in a world of mass-technology.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Woman Walks Ahead&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Stunning cinematography surrounds Jessica Chastain in the world premiere of this biographical drama from director Susannah White.
