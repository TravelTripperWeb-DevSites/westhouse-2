In anticipation, we chatted with Alexandre Calvi, City Winery&rsquo;s beverage director, to get his 6 tips about choosing the perfect wines for the holidays, and complementing your festive meal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Go for strong, earthy wines</strong></p>\n<p>&ldquo;As the season starts to show fall vegetables and flavors in the kitchen are getting stronger and earthier, the wines should follow. Whites wines aged in oak, such as Marsanne based or Viognier, are a good pairing. If you are looking for a red, try a light earthy wine like Beaujolais from France or Dolcetto d'Alba from Italy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>At dinners, keep it classic with pinot noir</strong></p>\n<p>&ldquo;When looking for a traditional wine to pair with your holiday meal, pinot noir from Oregon or California are the usual suspects.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Or buck tradition with a vintage port</strong></p>\n<p>Vintage ports are amazing with gravy and all the sauces that are served along the main dish.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Pair bubbles with dessert</strong></p>\n<p>&ldquo;With sweets, bubbles are great! Sparkling rose offers a great acidity and a nice fizz.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Look for something rich&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Steer clear of light, crisp wines. They aren&rsquo;t generally rich enough to pair with holiday meals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>When in doubt...go for champagne</strong></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Champagne is synonymous with celebration!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Want to learn more about wine?
