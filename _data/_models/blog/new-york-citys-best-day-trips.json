Create a healthy and sustainable food system that benefits everyone. A lofty task, but one that his 80-acre, nonprofit farm is working hard to fulfill. Each year, it welcomes thousands of visitors (including 7,000 students) to witness sustainable agriculture in the works, and to taste the benefits at the much-lauded onsite restaurant <a href=\"https://www.bluehillfarm.com/\">Blue Hill</a>. No mere afterthought, Blue Hill&rsquo;s main room is a reservations-only, fine-dining affair that is a New York Times favorite. A more casual counter area accepts walk-ins if you forget to book a table, and the experience is just as great.</p><p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"><br></p><p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.38;\"><b>For the History Scene</b></p><p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.38;\">Sleepy Hollow, NY</p><p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.38;\">29 miles north; 45 minutes by car; 1.25 hours by train<br><br><img height=\"664\" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/assets/8992/original/6274542476_b387d3a414_b_(1).jpg\" width=\"995\"><br></p><p style=\"margin: 0pt 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.38;\"><br></p><p>Yes, that Sleepy Hollow. Washington Irving set his unnerving legend in this Hudson Valley town after frequent visits to the region (where he also set &ldquo;Rip Van Winkle&rdquo;). Today, history buffs can learn all about the two stories and Irving, buried in the town cemetery, with the local historical society&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.thehistoricalsociety.net/\">walking tours</a>, as well as visit Sleepy Hollow&rsquo;s other notable sites like its charming 19th-century downtown and <a href=\"https://www.hudsonvalley.org/historic-sites/kykuit\" class=\"\">Kykuit</a>, a hilltop palace home to four generations of Rockefellers with stunning Hudson River views.<br></p><p><br></p>",
