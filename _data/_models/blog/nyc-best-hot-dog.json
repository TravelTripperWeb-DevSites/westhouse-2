While you can always stop at a Sabrett street cart (there are hundreds throughout Manhattan), we prefer these gourmet hot dog spots.</p>\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crif Dogs</h2>\n<p>Why you should visit: Since 2001, Crif Dogs has earned legions of fans thanks to its creative toppings. The standards&mdash;mustard, ketchup, sauerkraut, relish, onions&mdash;are free, but go crazy and add chili, pineapple, avocado, jalape&ntilde;os, baked beans and more to your dog.</p>\n<p>What you should order: The menu includes a classic, all-beef frankfurter ($2.50)&mdash;but go for the Crif Dog ($2.75), which is handmade with naturally smoked beef and pork. Vegetarians can enjoy the Veggie Special ($5), a veggie dog loaded with onions, tomaco, cucumber and jalape&ntilde;os.</p>\n<p>Special tip: Crif Dogs is open until 2am on weekdays and 4am on weekends, making it perfect spot for a post-bar snack. Or, if you&rsquo;re just heading out, stop in to carb-up before heading to PDT, the adjacent cocktail bar.<br /><br /></p>\n<p>Crif Dogs:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/tJKvjuJZwcs\">113 St. Marks Pl</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"tel:1-212-614-2728\">212-614-2728</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ditch Plains</h2>\n<p>Why you should visit: Can&rsquo;t make it to Montauk this summer? Ditch Plains&mdash;named after the beach in Montauk&mdash;brings a comfortable, beach-style hangout to Manhattan, all while serving oysters, lobster, and, of course, hot dogs.</p>\n<p>What you should order: The Ditch Dog ($12) piled high with mac and cheese.</p>\n<p>Special tip: Ditch Plains&rsquo; speciality cocktails&mdash;44 North Huckleberry Vodka and fresh lemonade ($13), for example&mdash;are perfect for summer, but their diverse and affordable menu of half bottles of wine should not be overlooked.</p>\n<p>Ditch Plains:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/GZsw6AEi9Tx\" target=\"_blank\">29 Bedford St</a>.,&nbsp;<a href=\"tel:1-212-633-0202\">212-633-0202</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>DBGB Kitchen &amp; Bar</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/DLihDIlfH07kZy_Q3CWjYCLqsvhMzpRIzo5zXJA0XQNx7qGjQQGh40gUnUm7aH3EwOQCuSpwztqQ04RA9S2ykBAZk1xojnYFy4gw9lkMHsyage7yxn_zxjy8doR-GMIPMqpqfaEa\" width=\"409px;\" height=\"409px;\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Why you should visit: Singapore-born chef Nicholas Tang helms the kitchen at Daniel Boulud&rsquo;s DBGB Kitchen and Bar, whose name is a playful nod to CBGB&mdash;the once-iconic, now-shuttered punk rock bar on the Bowery. That acronym is where the similarities end, though. DBGB is a brasserie with some of the best French comfort food in town.</p>\n<p>What you should order: The DBGB Dog ($10) with sauteed onion, mustard, ketchup, Boulud&rsquo;s signature &ldquo;299&rdquo; pickle relish, fris&eacute;e and radish.</p>\n<p>Special tip: Visit during happy hour, Sunday through Thursday from 5-7pm, for $1 oysters and $7 drinks before digging into a DBGB Dog.</p>\n<p>DBGB Kitchen &amp; Bar:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/NFM4YD8mdUP2\" target=\"_blank\">299 Bowery</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"tel:1-212-933-5300\">212-933-5300</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Honorable Mention: Katz&rsquo;s Delicatessen&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Why you should visit: There&rsquo;s nothing gourmet about it, but Katz&rsquo;s Delicatessen is a Manhattan institution.</p>\n<p>What you should order: True to form, the frankfurter ($3.95) at Katz&rsquo;s has no frills. The all-beef dog is seasoned with garlic, salt and paprika, topped with mustard and sauerkraut, and served on a soft bun.</p>\n<p>Special tip: The 1989 movie When Harry Met Sally was filed at Katz&rsquo;s. Sit where actors Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan sat&mdash;a sign above the table where filming took place reads: Where Harry Met Sally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Katz&rsquo;s Delicatessen:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/czqGicFGNDx\" target=\"_blank\">205 E. Houston St</a>.,&nbsp;<a href=\"tel:1-212-254-2246\">212-254-2246</a></p>",
