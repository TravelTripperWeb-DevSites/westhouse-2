Being single on February 14th means spending the evening in bed, binge-watching the least romantic series possible and avoiding the public crowds of happy couples and oversized teddy bears.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, spending the day in a relationship isn&rsquo;t always better. With decisions to make and plans to organize, it&rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of overthinking: is the restaurant too stuffy? Are red roses clich&eacute;? Either way - it can feel hard to win.</p>\n<p>We blame Hallmark for the oversaturation of pink hearts and saccharin-laced greeting cards at this time of year, but when it comes to Valentine&rsquo;s day, the real heart of the holiday is in the dessert.</p>\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re indulging yourself or your loved one, grab <a title=\"a bottle of champagne\" href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/offers/celebratory-package/\">a bottle of champagne</a> and celebrate with the best sweet treats New York has to offer.</p>\n<h4>Pies and Cakes and Cruffs, Oh My!</h4>\n<p>Sometimes, bigger is better. This includes <a title=\"Bubby&rsquo;s\" href=\"http://www.bubbys.com/menu/dessert/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bubby&rsquo;s</a> banoffee pie with bananas, dulce de leche, espresso, and fresh whipped cream. Pick-up a small slice at anytime, but if you call 24-hours in advance you can take-home a whole pie for the night.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Buttercup Bakeshop\" href=\"https://www.buttercupbakeshop.com/product-category/cakes/layered-cakes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buttercup Bakeshop</a> may be best known for their pocket-sized cupcakes, but their showstopper layer cakes are the perfect big-ticket winner for Valentines Day. Go classic with their German Chocolate or Lemon Cakes, or opt for the more adventurous Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly or Hummingbird Cakes.</p>\n<p>If deciding between donuts or ice cream is a struggle, satisfy both cravings with <a title=\"Stuffed Ice Cream&rsquo;s\" href=\"https://stuffedicecreamnyc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stuffed Ice Cream&rsquo;s</a> massive cruffs, or donuts stuffed with the ice cream flavor of your choice. From afar they look like the giant-sized Candy Land version of bagels - if cream cheese came in colorful flavors like &lsquo;Matcha Ma Call It&rsquo; and &lsquo;Unicorn Poop.&rsquo;</p>\n<h4>From Cocktail Bar to Dessert Bar</h4>\n<p>In recent years, New York has seen a slew of dessert bar openings, a craze most likely started by the popular <a title=\"Momofuku Milk Bar\" href=\"http://milkbarstore.com/main/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Momofuku Milk Bar</a>. With several locations throughout the city, take your pick from their cereal milk affogato, cake truffles, compost cookie cake, and blueberry and cream cookies.</p>\n<p>For a slightly more straightforward offering, try <a title=\"Chikalicious\" href=\"http://www.chikalicious.com/menu.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chikalicious</a>&rsquo; prix fixe dessert and petit four menu.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Spot Dessert Bar\" href=\"http://www.spotdessertbar.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spot Dessert Bar</a> calls their sweet spread &lsquo;dessert tapas&rsquo;, encouraging a selection of at least three different treats per visit. Sample their signature chocolate green tea lava cake, coconut monkey bread, or honey buttered toast. Or, splurge with the $55 omakase option where the dessert experts select a tasting menu for you.</p>\n<h4>Rock n&rsquo; Dough</h4>\n<p>If an entire menu of dessert is one step beyond your sweet tooth&rsquo;s limit, take your valentine to one of the many inspiring bakeries in the city for a modern twist on a classic pastry. Among <a title=\"Supermoon Bakehouse\" href=\"https://www.supermoonbakehouse.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Supermoon Bakehouse</a>&rsquo;s creations are the pina colada and banana split sundae croissants, and the mocha butterscotch and white sesame and saffron donuts.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Chip\" href=\"http://chipnewyorkcity.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chip</a> in Astoria claims to have the recipe for the city&rsquo;s best cookie. Choose between the blueberry cheesecake, chocolate chip, nutella, and butterscotch toffee flavors.</p>\n<p>The cronut fever has made its way across the world at this point, but the masters at <a title=\"Dominique Ansel\" href=\"https://dominiqueansel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dominique Ansel</a> still do it best. This famous french bakery reinvents some of the most recognizable treats, including their chocolate chip cookie shot glasses and kiwi sorbet bars.</p>\n<h4>For the Chocolate Lovers</h4>\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to go wrong with chocolate on Valentine&rsquo;s Day. From bonbons to truffles and drinking chocolate, New York has some of the best chocolatiers in the world to choose from.</p>\n<p>Start at <a title=\"Fine &amp; Raw\" href=\"http://fineandraw.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fine &amp; Raw</a> for a simple, artisan collection of house-made chocolates. Pick from one of their several bonbon and bar gift boxes to taste a little bit of everything that they make.</p>\n<p>Head to <a title=\"MarieBelle\" href=\"https://mariebelle.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MarieBelle</a> for expertly crafted ganache sets, each covered with uniquely intricate and beautiful designs.</p>\n<p>Mix a bit of savory into your chocolate at <a title=\"Nunu\" href=\"https://www.nunuchocolates.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nunu</a>&rsquo;s, whose creative bonbon flavors include boozy sake and absinthe or spicy mezcal-chili. Find a seat at the bar and order a craft beer to go with your chocolate-dipped potato chips.</p>\n<p>For some, the liquid drinking chocolate at <a title=\"Vosges\" href=\"https://www.vosgeschocolate.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vosges</a> in Soho is just the right remedy for a cold February night. Try one of their exotic truffles while you wait for the made-to-order drinking chocolate in either classic parisienne or the spicy aztec-chili flavor.</p>"
