Spring should have sprung by now, right? Every year New Yorkers wait patiently for an early thaw, and each year they&rsquo;re met with stubborn frost. That&rsquo;s why WestHouse&rsquo;s publicist Amanda says the tail of winter is the best time of year to treat yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Winter does a number on my skin and my sanity - so when March arrives I celebrate with a day at the spa. It&rsquo;s a happy reminder that regardless of outside temperatures, the end of winter is coming...eventually.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Amanda breaks down the best locations in the city to pamper yourself. Splurge on a massage, relax in warm waters and finish the evening with <a title=\"an in-room hair &amp; makeup service by Nomi Beauty\" href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/partners/nomi-beauty/\">an in-room hair &amp; makeup service by Nomi Beauty</a>. Your warm glow will outlast the spring slush.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Great Luxury at Great Jones</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;The specialty treatments at <a title=\"Great Jones Spa\" href=\"https://www.gjspa.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Great Jones Spa</a> spell luxurious for me. Who doesn&rsquo;t love an Instagram-famous water fountain? You can trust that a day at Great Jones will put the pep back in your winter step. The atmosphere can get pretty lively on the weekends, but I prefer the slower pace of a weekday visit. Come for the rock river facial and stay for the plunge pools, hot tub and wet lounge.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Find Tranquil at Shibui</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;The approach at <a title=\"Shibui Spa\" href=\"https://www.thegreenwichhotel.com/shibui-spa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shibui Spa</a> is more meditative than social. You can take in a yoga class before hitting the waters, but I usually go straight for the good stuff. The sake soak is the perfect post-travelling remedy - my skin is extra dry in the winter months and even drier after a plane ride, but this treatment always manages to add the moisture back in. &rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Shed Skin at Argana</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;I was in Morocco a few years ago when I went to my first Hammam, and I&rsquo;ve been obsessed ever since. The <a title=\"Argana Spa\" href=\"http://www.arganadayspany.com/services-traditional-moroccan-hammam.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Argana Spa</a> fits the bill when I want the same traditional experience here in New York. The ritual is a bit aggressive at first - the specialists scrub your skin with black soap (<em>made from crushed olives and olive oil</em>) to remove any dead skin before a nourishing body scrub and mask. It&rsquo;s very hands-on, which can be intimidating, but the effects are amazing. My skin has never been so soft.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Roman Delight at Aire</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be honest, the main attraction of <a title=\"Aire Ancient Baths\" href=\"https://beaire.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aire Ancient Baths</a> is the baths themselves. The dramatic setting transports you to a totally different world in time. And their signature wine bath is a great option for a decadent and luxurious afternoon.&rdquo;</p>"
