With warmer temperatures on the horizon, tourists and residents all over the city welcome the long-awaited wardrobe transition from winter parkas and snowshoes to rain jackets and spring boots. After months of keeping warm by the fire, there&rsquo;s no better way to welcome the season than to get outdoors.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for WestHouse residents, one of the most beautiful and world-renowned parks lies just five blocks from the hotel&rsquo;s doorstep: Central Park. With over 800 acres of green space to explore, you can spend hours in the spring sunshine by taking a walk in a meadow, playing a game of catch or rowing a boat. Here are some of our team&rsquo;s favorite ways to experience springtime in the park:</p>\n<h3>Row a Boat</h3>\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re looking for a romantic paddle or a memorable adventure, nothing beats the Lake at Loeb Boathouse. At just $15 for the hour (and $4 for each additional fifteen minutes), you&rsquo;ll have the best views of the lake and surrounding greenery. Grab lunch at the Boathouse Restaurant afterwards to extend your time - and views - of the lake.</p>\n<h3>Lilac Walk</h3>\n<p>Mid to late spring is the best time to visit the Lilac Walk in Central Park. A truly hidden-gem, the Lilac Walk runs along the north side of Sheep Meadow and is home to over twenty varieties of lilac blossoms from all over the world. Take a stroll along the pathway to see and smell the fragrant purple, pink, and white blooms from countries like France, the Netherlands, Canada and China.</p>\n<h3>The Shakespeare Garden</h3>\n<p>Awake your inner-bard with a visit to The Shakespeare Garden, located between Belvedere Castle and The Swedish Cottage. Created over 100 years ago, the garden (originally designed to emulate Victorian rock gardens) now contains plants only mentioned in Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays, including the columbine, quince, lark&rsquo;s heel and primrose plants.</p>\n<h3>Picnic with Alice and Wonderland</h3>\n<p>Take a break from your walk in the park with an outdoor tea-party with one of literature&rsquo;s famously curious characters. The Alice and Wonderland statue, commissioned by philanthropist George Delacorte in honor of his wife, sits close to the Conservatory Water. Bring a picnic basket and sit on one of the benches facing this larger-than-life bronze sculpture.</p>\n<p>Worried about the weather? Don&rsquo;t be.
