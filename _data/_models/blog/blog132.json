But it&rsquo;s also a city known for its innovation and entrepreneurial success. Ever year, history is made with new developments and creations, and this year, Hudson Yards tops the list of exciting new ventures.</p>\n<p>With buildings spanning west 30th and 34th streets between 10th and 11th avenues, <a title=\"Hudson Yards\" href=\"https://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hudson Yards</a> is the largest private real estate development in the history of the United States. Just a ten-minute cab ride from <a title=\"WestHouse\" href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/\">WestHouse</a> lies more than 18 million square feet of commercial and residential space that&rsquo;s home to over 100 shops and restaurants and the world&rsquo;s first Equinox Hotel&reg;. Explore the cultural center of the New West Side at Hudson Yards and see what brilliant new adventures unfold.</p>\n<h3>See Original Works of Art at <a title=\"The Shed\" href=\"https://theshed.org/program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Shed</a></h3>\n<p>There are several eye-catching buildings that form part of Hudson Yards&rsquo; skyline, and one of them is The Shed. Designed as a versatile structure, The Shed&rsquo;s impressive outer shell can physically transform itself to fit various performance styles. The adjoining plaza, the McCourt, is the perfect outdoor space for large-scale performances, installations and events, currently showcasing a visual art commission from Lawrence Weiner called <em>In Front of Itself</em>.</p>\n<p>As a group, The Shed commissions original works of art across all disciplines, like hip-hop, dance, classical music, sculpture, digital media, theater, literature and more. The Shed aims to create a warm and welcoming space that&rsquo;s open to everyone and supports unique artistic experiences. The space opens this April with programs including a five-night concert series celebrating the influence of African American music entitled <em>Soundtrack of America,</em> and an immersive live art performance conceived by painter Gerhard Richter and composer Steve Reich.
