The world&rsquo;s largest and oldest St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade (even older than the one in Ireland) is marked by a flood of marching green on 5th avenue, including adults in leprechaun costumes and the city&rsquo;s 69th Infantry leading the pack. The parade is one of the city&rsquo;s oldest and most participated traditions. But for some, it&rsquo;s not the only way to celebrate the day.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;After ten years of watching and attending the parade, I decided it was time to find my own traditions,&rdquo; says Aidan, a New York resident of twelve years. &ldquo;The parade is on another level, but that&rsquo;s not always how I want to commemorate the holiday.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Aidan gives us an inside look at how he likes to spend the day that honors his culture and community in his adopted hometown.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>At breakfast</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;Corned beef and St. Patrick&rsquo;s day go hand in hand for me. There are a few bars around town that make a great spread on the holiday, like <a title=\"The Dead Rabbit\" href=\"https://www.deadrabbitnyc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Dead Rabbit</a> or <a title=\"Molly&rsquo;s\" href=\"http://www.mollysshebeennyc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Molly&rsquo;s</a>. One year a friend took me to the <a title=\"Russian Tea Room\" href=\"http://www.russiantearoomnyc.com/menus/st-pats/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAq6_UBRCEARIsAHyrgUw7j2xUoVm0kqUmlpZ1D6HXZpC984EMfZMTL9hhgdvQ4_OBw60oJQcaAnBxEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Russian Tea Room</a>, where you can get a surprisingly authentic three-course Irish menu.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>On exhibit</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go every year, but the <a title=\"Merchant House Museum\" href=\"http://merchantshouse.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Merchant House Museum</a> is a fascinating visit, particularly around the holiday. The house is a powerful remnant demonstrating what domestic life was like in the 19th century for Irish servants. Especially in comparison with the lives of the wealthy family they served.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>On stage</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;<a title=\"The Irish Repertory Theater\" href=\"https://irishrep.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Irish Repertory Theater</a> has some fantastic shows on at this time of year. Walking into the theater always feels fitting around the holiday. Last year I saw an incredible rendition of an Eugene O&rsquo;Neil play - hearing these stories is a great way to get in the spirit.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>In tune</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;My all-time favorite way to close St. Patrick&rsquo;s day is with live music. There are several great spots that showcase Irish musicians and musicians that play Irish music on the night. If I had any musical talent, I&rsquo;d play along with them at <a title=\"Landmark Tavern\" href=\"https://www.thelandmarktavern.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landmark Tavern</a>, <a title=\"The Porterhouse\" href=\"http://www.frauncestavern.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Porterhouse</a> or <a title=\"Gramercy Ale House\" href=\"http://www.gramercyalehouse.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gramercy Ale House</a>.&rdquo;</p>"
