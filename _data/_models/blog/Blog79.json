Come January first, the average question on most New Yorkers mind is the same: exactly how many more weeks do we have left of winter?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Alice, WestHouse&rsquo;s photographer, agrees: &ldquo;The winter blues are real. When it snows on Christmas I get butterflies in my stomach, but when it snows in January I don&rsquo;t want to get out of bed. &rdquo; The emotional hangover from the holidays can leave a real dent in the new year, but luckily Alice has the cure: soul-warming nightlife.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;January is the perfect treat yo&rsquo;self month. The holidays can get pretty stressful, so afterwards I give myself a whole month to recalibrate. I spend the evenings listening to great music and enjoying the city after the craziness of December.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Another Year, Another Jazzfest</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;<a title=\"Winter Jazzfest\" href=\"http://www.winterjazzfest.com/tickets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Winter Jazzfest</a> often gets overlooked after the holidays, but it&rsquo;s one of my favorite concerts of the year. It&rsquo;s an eclectic showcase of up-and-coming and veteran musicians that play at different venues downtown. Who doesn&rsquo;t love a post-holiday marathon of great music in some of the best nightclubs and performance spaces in the city? It&rsquo;s the ideal way to kick-start the new year.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Cozy Cocktails</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a firm believer in the year-round cocktail - finding great drinks shouldn&rsquo;t be relegated to just the holidays! And winter is an especially good time to cozy up with a drink that warms you from the inside out. I&rsquo;m a sucker for big leather chairs, so the <a title=\"Westhouse Den\" href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/westhouse-hotel-new-york-dining/the-den/\">Westhouse Den</a> is one of my favorite spots for an evening sip. The interior is so plush and comfortable. Also, the fireplaces at <a title=\"Art Bar\" href=\"http://www.artbar.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Art Bar</a> and the <a title=\"Flatiron Room\" href=\"https://www.theflatironroom.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flatiron Room</a> are the perfect remedy on a particularly cold night.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Dining Out in the New Year&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;I generally avoid the restaurant scene during the holidays - everything gets overbooked and overcrowded really quickly. In December, I cook for friends and family at my place, or I&rsquo;ll spend evenings at theirs for holiday dinners and parties. That way, I can really take advantage of going out to eat in January, without the stress and hassle of the holidays. My current favorites are <a title=\"De Maria\" href=\"https://www.demarianyc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">De Maria</a> and <a title=\"Jack&rsquo;s Wife Freda\" href=\"http://jackswifefreda.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jack&rsquo;s Wife Freda</a>, and the small menu at <a title=\"White Gold Butchers\" href=\"https://www.whitegoldbutchers.com/location/restaurant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">White Gold Butchers</a> gets everything right. If I want to try something new, I&rsquo;ll pick a spot during <a title=\"restaurant week\" href=\"https://www.nycgo.com/restaurant-week\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">restaurant week</a> - their tasting menus are a great way to try the best of what each place has to offer.&rdquo;</p>"
