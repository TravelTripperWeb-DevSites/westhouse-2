But when I have friends in town I take them to the smaller playhouses. Your chances of seeing authentic, surprising material are just so much higher when you travel outside of that four-block Broadway radius.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To be clear, Erica doesn&rsquo;t suggest skipping over the big-name houses entirely: &ldquo;I love Broadway, but if you come to the city to experience the heart of New York&rsquo;s theater, you have to branch out. Seeing a mix of Broadway and Off-Broadway shows will help give you a better picture of the theater community as a whole.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Though most of the Off-Broadway theaters won&rsquo;t have the same budget as the bigger venues, that&rsquo;s all part of the appeal according to Erica: &ldquo;The focus ends up being on the message of the piece, rather than the visual effects. It&rsquo;s a much more intimate and thoughtful experience, which is what keeps drawing me back to these theaters.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here, Erica breaks down her go-to recommendations for a great Off-Broadway experience:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>The Big Players</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;Not all Off-Broadway theaters are small, black-box spaces. <a title=\"The Public Theater\" href=\"https://www.publictheater.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Public Theater</a> is one the biggest Off-Broadway theaters in the city. It&rsquo;s put on some extremely successful shows with big name stars, and has a good variety of both classic and new works. If you&rsquo;re looking for a theater to bridge the gap between Broadway and Off-Broadway - this is the place to start. Another one is <a title=\"Playwrights Horizons\" href=\"https://www.playwrightshorizons.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Playwrights Horizons</a>, which shows exclusively new pieces by emerging artists. There&rsquo;s also the <a title=\"Lincoln Center Theater\" href=\"http://www.lct.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lincoln Center Theater</a>, which includes the Mitzi Newhouse, Vivian Beaumont and Claire Tow theaters, has a wide selection of plays and musicals and is the largest non-for-profit theater in the country.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>The Downtown Players</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;Downtown Manhattan is an amazing playground for Off-Broadway. During peak season, you can spend a weekend hopping between theaters. <a title=\"Vineyard\" href=\"http://www.vineyardtheatre.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vineyard</a>, <a title=\"Rattlestick\" href=\"http://www.rattlestick.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rattlestick</a>, <a title=\"Soho Repa\" href=\"http://sohorep.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Soho Repa</a>, <a title=\"Cherry Lane\" href=\"http://www.cherrylanetheatre.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cherry Lane</a>, and <a title=\"Barrow Street\" href=\"http://www.barrowstreettheatre.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Barrow Street</a> are some of my favorites and they all have a fantastic line-up of popular and new works.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>The Brooklyn Players</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;Both <a title=\"BAM\" href=\"https://www.bam.org/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BAM</a> and <a title=\"St. Ann&rsquo;s Warehouse\" href=\"http://stannswarehouse.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">St. Ann&rsquo;s Warehouse</a> in Brooklyn have a reputation for being the go-to houses for touring productions from Europe. Plus, BAM has an impressive repertoire of dance, film and opera productions too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>The Classic Players</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;I always get a thrill from seeing new works onstage because you never know which one is going to &lsquo;be a hit.&rsquo; You might be in the audience for the next big thing, but then again, probably not. Going Off-Broadway is a roll-of-the-dice in that way. So if you prefer to know what you&rsquo;re getting when you walk-in, try the <a title=\"Classic Stage Company\" href=\"https://classicstage.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Classic Stage Company</a>, which does contemporary versions of classic, well-known plays.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>The Underground Players</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;Sometimes you want to see something a little more out-of-the-box and experimental. <a title=\"Ars Nova\" href=\"http://arsnovanyc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ars Nova</a> in midtown and the <a title=\"Bushwick Starr\" href=\"https://www.thebushwickstarr.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bushwick Starr</a> in Brooklyn are the best alternatives to a basic theater experience.&rdquo;</p>",
