Couples romantically unite at the top of the empire state building, and miracles really do happen on 34th street. And if the wisdom spun in the classic <em>When Harry Met Sally</em> is true - and it probably is - then we know that restaurants&nbsp; were &ldquo;to people in the '80s what theater was to people in the '60s.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Except that today, one important caveat has changed. We still love to eat (arguably more so than ever), but we&rsquo;re no longer confined to the four walls of restaurants. In 2018, the most adventurous food experiences are taking place outside. And this summer, you can experience the best of the best at Smorgasburg.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Smorgasburg\" href=\"https://www.smorgasburg.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Smorgasburg</a>, or what the New York Times called, &ldquo;The Woodstock of Eating,&rdquo; is the largest open-air food market in the country and it&rsquo;s back for its seventh year of culinary excitement. Whether you&rsquo;re visiting the Brooklyn waterfront on Saturday or Prospect Park on Sunday, here&rsquo;s what you should be trying:</p>\n<h3>Squid Yakisoba, by Yakisoba NYC</h3>\n<p>Lay grilled jumbo squid on top of Japanese fried noodles drizzled in a uniquely sweet and spicy sauce, and you&rsquo;ll have the enormous wonder that is yakisoba. If you&rsquo;re in the mood for a challenge, this insanely delicious and massively portioned dish will make all of your seafood and umami dreams come true.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>The Spaghetti Donut, by Pop Pasta&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Nothing about this American-Italian hybrid should make sense, but to every skeptic&rsquo;s delight - it does. The Neapolitan tradition of &lsquo;frittata di spaghetti&rsquo;, or frying leftover pasta with eggs and cheese, fits perfectly in the beloved and portable American donut shape. Try the Carbonara Pop for a mouthful of too-good goodness.</p>\n<h3>Nutella S&rsquo;mores Ice Cream with Torched Marshmallow by Bona Bona Ice Cream&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Think of the best part of your childhood campfire dessert sitting right on top of expertly crafted ice cream. That&rsquo;s Bona Bona&rsquo;s approach in a nutshell - or rather, cone. What better way to spend a summer afternoon than with a handful of sinfully perfect sweetness?&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Coconut Flan Br&ucirc;l&eacute;e with Ube, by Ube Kitchen</h3>\n<p>This purple delight will smash the expectations of coconut <em>and</em> vegan haters alike. Even meat and dairy lovers will see the light in this beautiful mix of a tropical meets plant-based bite. The Filipino-inspired treat hits the mark when it comes to healthy-but-satisfying indulgence - not to mention it&rsquo;s so good looking, don&rsquo;t be surprised if you take out your phone and capture the soon-to-be jealousy of all of your friends.</p>"
