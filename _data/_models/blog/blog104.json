Most travellers understand that to experience new tastes, sights and cultures isn&rsquo;t just a thrill, but a gift. At WestHouse, we welcome guests from every corner of the globe and are proud to offer our \"house away from home\" to all who share a passion for exploring. And while it's true that travel is one of the most rewarding and illuminating adventures available - it can also be one of the most exhausting.</p>\n<p>After a busy day of seeing sights, walking new roads and finding your way from point A to point B, sometimes you just want to put your feet up. That's why we make it as easy and luxurious as possible to give yourself an indulgent night-in while still feeling like you're on vacation.</p>\n<h3>Relax with a drink in <a title=\"The Den\" href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/dining/the-den/\">The Den</a></h3>\n<p>Cozy up after a day of touring in our plush, speakeasy-themed lounge. With its crystal chandeliers, eucalyptus wood accents and an antique fireplace, you won't have to sacrifice elegance for comfort. At dusk, grab a seat near the first-floor windows and watch the sunset bounce off of the neighboring buildings while you sip on a cacao fruit-infused Old Fashioned.</p>\n<h3>Grab a bite on <a title=\"The Terrace\" href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/dining/the-terrace/\">The Terrace</a></h3>\n<p>If you're still a bit peckish after your cocktail, head up to the outdoor terrace on the 23rd floor to sample the snacks and bites available until 7pm each day. If you're looking for a bigger meal, ask our <a title=\"concierge\" href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/amenities/luxury-lifestyle-concierge/\">concierge</a> for the best dining or take-out recommendations in the area.</p>\n<h3>Let it rain</h3>\n<p>Nothing helps you decompress more than a soothing shower. After a day on your feet, step into our steam-free glass-enclosed rain shower and take your relaxation to the next level with the bespoke <a title=\"DayNa Decker bath and body products\" href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/partners/dayna-decker-luxury-candles/\">DayNa Decker bath and body products</a>.</p>\n<h3>Settle in with <a title=\"Sleep Studio\" href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/partners/nyc-luxury-hotel-bedding-sleep-studio/\">Sleep | Studio</a></h3>\n<p>Once you're ready to turn in, enjoy the technologically advanced beds that New York's own SoHo-based Sleep | Studio has to offer, available to guests in every Terrace Suite.
