Regardless of what&rsquo;s inside the cup, all that matters is having <a title=\"the great outdoor space\" href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/dining/the-terrace/\">the great outdoor space</a> to sip it in.</p>\n<p>For others, finding the right libation to celebrate the end of winter is one of the most exciting rituals during this time of year. We asked our staff members where they go to toast the start of the new season:&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><a title=\"Et Al\" href=\"http://etal-nyc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Et Al</a>, Lower East Side</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;The atmosphere is more club than rooftop garden, but their cocktails are exactly what I crave at this time of year. My favorite drink is the &lsquo;Fuck You Steve&rsquo;, which tastes like a beach in a glass with its mix of mezcal, pineapple, and Campari.&rdquo;- Alexis&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><a title=\"Fine &amp; Rare\" href=\"https://www.fineandrare.nyc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fine &amp; Rare</a>, Midtown</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;This is the best place for old fashioneds, year-round. Though to be fair, in my mind, every season is the right season for an old fashioned. They specialize in a couple of varieties, both of which come smoked according to your liking - I love the hickory. My wife usually orders the &lsquo;Catamaran&rsquo;, which tastes exactly as it sounds.&rdquo; -&nbsp; Francis&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><a title=\"Bessou\" href=\"http://bessou.nyc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bessou</a>, Lower East Side</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get enough of the sake milk punch at Bessour. It&rsquo;s the most refreshing cocktail around - not to mention that it arrives looking like spring in a glass with its mint leaves, star anise and pomegranate seeds.&rdquo;&nbsp; - Lucy&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><a title=\"The Den\" href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/dining/the-den/\">The Den</a>, Midtown</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;Tuesday nights are the best nights in The Den at WestHouse. With a silent movie in the background, a classic cocktail and popcorn in hand, it&rsquo;s easy to slip into that Saturday feeling. The best drink on the menu is still the &lsquo;Oldie But Goodie&rsquo;, our signature crafted cocktail infused with cacao fruit.&rdquo; - Andy&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><a title=\"Maison Premiere\" href=\"https://maisonpremiere.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Maison Premiere</a>, Brooklyn</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;As soon as the snow melts my roommate and I go around the corner from our apartment for oysters and cocktails at Maison Premiere. We recently discovered the drink called the &lsquo;Walcott Express&rsquo;, which is super spring appropriate given its light green color. It takes herbal flavors to a whole new level.&rdquo; - Angela</p>"
