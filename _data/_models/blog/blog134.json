Frieze&rsquo;s Spotlight aims to showcase pieces from modern masters that are overlooked or rarely seen by the public. This year, Hoptman is focusing on artists with important stories to share, like modern pioneers Louise Fishman, Knox Martin and Elvira Bach. 2019&rsquo;s Spotlight section will also have a special emphasis on the &ldquo;radical potential of drawing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><img id=\"1556781093607\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1556781090/mkorvrvklqcofyiutzqf.jpg\" alt=\"sculptures\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1556781090/mkorvrvklqcofyiutzqf.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1556781090/mkorvrvklqcofyiutzqf.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1556781090/mkorvrvklqcofyiutzqf.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1556781090/mkorvrvklqcofyiutzqf.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1556781090/mkorvrvklqcofyiutzqf.jpg\" /></p>\n<h3>Move Between the Sculptures</h3>\n<p>2019&rsquo;s Frieze Artist Award Winner, Lauren Halsey, has been commissioned to create an architectural invention for this year&rsquo;s fair. Her work is known for incorporating found objects and serving as standalone, interactive spaces. Inspired by Afrofuturism, hip hop and funk, Halsey often collaborates with the South Central L.A. community in which she lives. For this year&rsquo;s Frieze New York, Halsey has created a space of columns and other structures that visitors will be encouraged to move around and experience, offering a unique opportunity to interact directly with the art.</p>\n<h3>Discover the Art of Virtual Reality</h3>\n<p>Nowadays, it&rsquo;s hard to escape the advances of technology, even in the art world. This year marks an exciting debut of an exhibit centered on Virtual Reality. Daniel Birnbaum, the former Director of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, has curated the exhibition to illustrate the most exciting advances in reality art production.</p>\n<h3>Get Lost in the Reading Room</h3>\n<p>Want to take a break from the visual stimulation?
