New Yorkers walk, ride and bike their streets every day - which makes them the best source for untapped wonders.</p>\n<p>Of course, with a city as beloved and well traveled like New York, secret spots are few and far in between. Still, each year we&rsquo;re surprised to learn of a new ice cream shop, boutique or park that we&rsquo;ve yet to have stumbled upon. For a visitor, the discovery is even more exciting because it offers the chance to experience the city like a true local.</p>\n<p>Andrew, a WestHouse <a title=\"valet\" href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/offer/#-25-valet-parking-package\">valet</a>, has a passion for green spaces. When asked about what it&rsquo;s like to live in a city while loving the outdoors, he admits, &ldquo;New York is a concrete jungle, of course, but we are extremely lucky to have our fair share of communal parks here too.&rdquo; He continues, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very important to me to see nature every day. Whether that means walking through the park on my way home or having my lunch break by the river, I make it a priority to take advantage of the greenery the city has to offer.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When we asked him which park in the city was his favorite, he hesitated to answer:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Part of me has a hard time answering that question because there are so many parks here in the city that I love. Another part of me struggles to answer because the smaller parks that I love are great because they&rsquo;re just that: small and rarely frequented by tourists. But the truth is that one of my favorite green spaces in the city is a small space called Greenacre Park.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><a title=\"Greenacre Park\" href=\"https://tclf.org/landscapes/greenacre-park\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Greenacre Park</a> is a privately owned but publicly accessible park just ten blocks from WestHouse on East 51st Street. The site is smartly divided into separate spaces with different features including a 25-foot waterfall, honey locust trees, azaleas and textural variation. Just last year it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>\n<p>Sounds like the perfect escape for a city <em>and</em> nature lover.</p>",
