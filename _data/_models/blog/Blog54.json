The Big Apple. The City that Never Sleeps. Whatever you call New York City, there&rsquo;s no denying that it&rsquo;s one of the most exciting places on earth. Not only do we love living here, but we also love stories that are set here. There&rsquo;s something special about reading a book, real or fictional, that takes place on familiar streets. The next time you&rsquo;re in New York, we recommend bringing along one of these titles about the City So Nice, They Named It Twice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><em>NEVER CAN SAY GOODBYE</em> EDITED BY SARI BOTTON</h4>\n<p>How do we love New York City? Let us count the ways. We love early morning walks in Central Park, finding a new brunch place, exploring museums, shopping on 5th Avenue, and meeting friends for cocktails. But that&rsquo;s just us. In <em>Never Can Say Goodbye: Writers on Their Unshakable Love for New York</em>, New Yorkers share the many reasons they live in the concrete jungle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><em>A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN</em> BY BETTY SMITH</h4>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve never read this classic novel, a trip to New York is the perfect time to pick it up. Just imagine reading about the slums of Williamsburg, Brooklyn in the early 1900s &mdash; and then visiting the now-booming neighborhood in person. You&rsquo;ll feel a strong connection to New York&rsquo;s well-documented past.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><em>MAPPING MANHATTAN</em> BY BECKY COOPER</h4>\n<p>What does &ldquo;your&rdquo; New York City look like? Whether you&rsquo;re a first-time visitor, a frequent traveler, or a life-long resident, you have a version of the city that lives in your head. Maybe it&rsquo;s a quiet avenue in Tribeca, or a trendy street in SoHo. <em>Mapping Manhattan</em> is a book of maps that shows people&rsquo;s different versions of the city, allowing readers to see New York from a variety of diverse perspectives.</p>\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\n<h4><em>NEW YORK DIARIES</em> EDITED BY TERESA CARPENTER</h4>\n<p>New York City is a melting pot of people and ideas. All of those perspectives unite in <em>New York Diaries: 1609 to 2009</em>. New York Times bestselling author Teresa Carpenter carefully searched private collections and library archives to create the ultimate diary of the city. The book starts on January 1 and includes an entry from every day of the year &mdash; but the actual year varies, falling anywhere between the early 1600s to the present.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><em>BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY&rsquo;S</em> BY TRUMAN CAPOTE</h4>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve seen the movie starring Audrey Hepburn. But have you read the book by Truman Capote? The quirky, charming story of Holly Golightly is a quick read, perfect for a weekend in New York City. Of course, we recommend a trip to Tiffany&rsquo;s while you&rsquo;re here.</p>"
