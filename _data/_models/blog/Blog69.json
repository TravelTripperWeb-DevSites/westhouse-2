For most of us, spending an afternoon people watching is an infrequent pastime. But for Alex, it&rsquo;s an art form: &ldquo;Working in a hotel, I meet people from all around the world. Spending time in New York offers a similar opportunity. There are millions of people from every different background in this one busy and vibrant place. It&rsquo;s the perfect melting pot of characters, which also makes it the perfect city for people watching.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For those who feel little uneasy about the idea of spending the day peering in on a stranger&rsquo;s life, Alex gives this reassurance: &ldquo;New Yorkers want to be seen. So many restaurants, bars and cafes exist solely for this purpose. It&rsquo;s deeply ingrained in the city&rsquo;s culture.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When it comes to people watching, there are some dos and don&rsquo;ts. We asked Alex to explain how best to spend an afternoon watching the city:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Q: What are the best places for people watching in New York?</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;It depends on what you&rsquo;re looking for and where you are in the city. Each neighborhood has its own hotspots. People watching on Bedford Ave in Williamsburg will be a very different experience from people watching on 125th street in Harlem, but I&rsquo;ve done both and they are equally amazing. If I&rsquo;m in the mood to dine with Soho socialites I&rsquo;ll grab a coffee at <a title=\"Cafe Select\" href=\"http://www.cafeselectnyc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cafe Select</a>, have a meal at iconic <a title=\"Balthazar\" href=\"http://balthazarny.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Balthazar</a> or, if I&rsquo;m feeling ambitious, go for an evening out at <a title=\"Vandal\" href=\"http://www.vandalnewyork.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vandal</a>. If I&rsquo;m headed uptown I&rsquo;ll order a cocktail at <a title=\"Penrose\" href=\"https://www.penrosebar.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Penrose</a> or <a title=\"Bemelman&rsquo;s\" href=\"https://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/the-carlyle-new-york/dining/bemelmans-bar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bemelman&rsquo;s</a>. To see fashionable Williamsburg, I&rsquo;ll stop at <a title=\"Cafe Mogador\" href=\"http://www.cafemogador.com/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cafe Mogador</a>. And if I want a more classic New York people watching experience, I&rsquo;ll catch some jazz at <a title=\"Bill&rsquo;s Place\" href=\"http://www.billsplaceharlem.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bill&rsquo;s Place</a> in Harlem.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Q: What are the no-no&rsquo;s?</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stare. It can be a fine line between appreciating or admiring the scene and straight out staring at one individual. I like to think of people watching as casting a wide net: you&rsquo;re interested in the entire area, not just one specific pinpoint.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Q: What if you accidentally eavesdrop on someone&rsquo;s conversation?</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;It happens! Even when you&rsquo;re not people watching, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to catch fragments of conversations in a tightly packed city. When I think I&rsquo;m listening too much to a nearby conversation, I&rsquo;ll make up an alternate one in my head. The conversation I create is usually more interesting, anyways.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Q: Do you bring something to read or take someone along with you?</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;I think people watching is one of those activities that&rsquo;s best done solo, but if you and a friend are on the same page - go for it. I carry a notebook with me everywhere, so I usually have it with me when I&rsquo;m people watching. If inspiration strikes I can jot down my notes or draw something on the page. I&rsquo;m terrible at drawing, but do it anyways because it helps me clear my mind.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Q: What&rsquo;s the best thing you&rsquo;ve seen while people watching?</h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a tough one. I once saw a man walking down the street with four parrots on his shoulders and a boa constrictor wrapped around his torso. The birds were unbothered by the large snake, and the guy thought it was totally normal, even though everyone around him clearly didn&rsquo;t. I also remember a woman on Central Park West who was dressed head-to-toe in leopard print. Even her hair was dyed in spots to look like a leopard. She was very elegant, in a strange, only in New York kind of way.</p>",
