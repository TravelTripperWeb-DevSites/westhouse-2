The month-long, multidisciplinary affair features international musical ensembles, dance performances&mdash;even puppetry.</p>\n<p>With no less than 41 performances and discussions, there are plenty of opportunities for locals and visitors to experience the event. But if you want to see White Light like an insider, read on for our tips to having a VIP experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Become a Member </strong></p>\n<p>The best way to see the White Light Festival like a VIP is to become a Friend of Lincoln Center. Memberships start at just $100, which would give you access to presale tickets to White Light performances. But the real perks are at the top, for Charter Members donating at least $2,000 a year. At this level, you'll see Playbill recognition, receive steep discounts on private tours, and have access to members-only events and rehearsals, plus a concierge service and VIP ticketing. While not worth it for visitors who come to New York only once or twice a year, this option sees major benefits for more frequent visitors.</p>\n<p><strong>Stick Around for the Lounges </strong></p>\n<p>After most performances (there are dozens scattered across 10 different venues), White Light Lounge events take place: These receptions are exclusive to White Light Festival ticket holders. Here, you can rub elbows with artists and your fellow guests&mdash;with a complimentary glass of wine, of course.</p>\n<p><strong>Purchase a Package</strong></p>\n<p>At least eight performances this year are directly inspired by art and music from the East, forming the Sounds of India portion of the festival. Tickets start at $72 and attendants who purchase at least three will save 20% on the total price.</p>\n<p><strong>Drop in On a Free </strong></p>\n<p>Show If you want to experience one of New York City&rsquo;s signature art events without splurging, a number of White Light Festival performances and discussions are free to the public. Drop into one of these for a low commitment (but very high brow) experience.</p>\n<p>For a full list of calendar events, visit the <a href=\"https://whitelightfestival.org/calendar\" target=\"_blank\">White Light Festival website</a>.</p>",
