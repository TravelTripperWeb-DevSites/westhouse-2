  "contents": "<p>Easter celebrations are aplenty in New York City, including the annual Easter Parade and Bonnet Festival. Every year on Easter Sunday Fifth Avenue closes for transport between 49th and 57th streets (just two blocks away from <a title=\"WestHouse\" href=\"/\">WestHouse</a>) for spring and Easter-themed fun. The unofficial Bonnet Festival that ensues includes creative and handmade bonnets, costumes, and accompanying flowers and live animals. Stopping by this jubilant parade is a great way to get into the spirit of the holiday, but if you&rsquo;re like most of us, you&rsquo;ll want to continue the celebration over a great meal. Try one of these nearby restaurants for a delicious Easter Brunch, no clean-up required.</p>\n<h3>Easter Buffet at <a title=\"Jams\" href=\"http://www.jamsrestaurant.nyc/easter-brunch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jams</a></h3>\n<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s easier to keep the celebrations all-in-one place. The Easter Buffet at Jams Restaurant does just that. Located just four blocks from WestHouse (and one block from the Bonnet Festival on 5th Avenue), you won&rsquo;t have to travel far for your farm fresh eggs or avocado toast. For a $45 prix-fixe price (or $60 if you want to add-on unlimited Mimosas or Bellinis) you and your friends can have your fill of house-made pastries, locally smoked ham, the build-you-own omelet station and more.</p>\n<p><img id=\"1553685552837\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1553685546/htdurfjj66rvpvnkxhyw.jpg\" alt=\"Easter Buffet at Jams\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1553685546/htdurfjj66rvpvnkxhyw.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1553685546/htdurfjj66rvpvnkxhyw.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1553685546/htdurfjj66rvpvnkxhyw.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1553685546/htdurfjj66rvpvnkxhyw.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1553685546/htdurfjj66rvpvnkxhyw.jpg\" /></p>\n<h3>Dine in Style at the <a title=\"Polo Bar\" href=\"https://www.ralphlauren.com/global-polo-bar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Polo Bar</a></h3>\n<p>American style icon Ralph Lauren opened his first New York restaurant, Polo Bar, in 2015.
