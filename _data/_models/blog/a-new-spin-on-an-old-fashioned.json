  "preview": "<p>An Old Fashioned, which is whiskey or brandy muddled with sugar and bitters, topped with a twist of citrus, has taken on a distinctive new taste with the grand opening of The Den, WestHouse&rsquo;s speakeasy-inspired lounge. The &ldquo;Oldie But Goodie,\" our first signature cocktail, created by Rael Petit—a highly acclaimed NYC—based mixologist wins with its fashionable version of the retro drink exclusively made for WestHouse Hotel New York. Rather than bourbon, our cocktail consists of Solbeso, a new South American spirit distilled from the pulpy fruit surrounding cacao beans. The taste is strong but balanced, with both fruity and earthy flavors. Petit then adds 18.21 Bitters, handcrafted premium bitters from Atlanta, Georgia, and finishes with the classic orange twist, plus a brandied cherry. The elegant and remarkably interesting cocktail complements The Den&rsquo;s fresh and modern take on the Prohibition era.\n</p>",
