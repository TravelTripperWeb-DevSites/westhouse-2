From September 16 until October 1, head to these restaurants participating in the Billion Oyster Shell project&mdash;donating oyster shells instead of throwing them away so they can be used to restore New York Harbor&rsquo;s oyster reefs and help the city reclaim its title as the oyster capital of the world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Oceana&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Exploring Rockefeller Center?
