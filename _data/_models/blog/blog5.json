In a city that&rsquo;s always moving, coffee is as vital to the culture as reliable subway tracks. And it&rsquo;s no new trend either.</p>\n<p>Before there were baristas on every corner, early New Yorkers made their coffee at home - from scratch. The dangerous trade soon turned into an island-wide obsession, paving the way for our trendsetting addiction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Home-brewed to Counter-made</h3>\n<p>Author Erin Meister tracks coffee&rsquo;s evolution in the city, starting with its patriotic symbolism during the Revolutionary War to Alice Foote MacDouglass&rsquo; coffeehouse empire launch in 1920. Her book, <a title=\"New York City Coffee: A Caffeinated History\" href=\"https://www.arcadiapublishing.com/Products/9781467136006\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New York City Coffee: A Caffeinated History</a>, explores the roots of the beverage&rsquo;s history in the city and how it&rsquo;s shaped generations of complex and diverse people.</p>\n<p>Initially, coffee was roasted at home by the bold and fearless New York housewives at the turn of the 18th century. The process was extremely dangerous and unpleasant (due to both the smoke <em>and</em> the smell) - but these women continued until a more practical invention enabled roasting on a mass-production level. Mass roasting spread the java-delight even further, converting Lower Manhattan into what was then known as the Coffee District. The &lsquo;Coffee District&rsquo; of New York led the nation in both production and imports until the 20th century.</p>\n<p>Since the 1900&rsquo;s, New York has maintained both an exclusive and dependent relationship with coffee.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s one of the only cities in the world where you can find the most expensive <em>and</em> least expensive cup of joe in the same five block radius. What&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;ll find loyal residents that can speak the praises of both.</p>\n<p>At WestHouse, we celebrate our city&rsquo;s dedication to the drink with every <a title=\"resident breakfast service\" href=\"https://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/dining/\">resident breakfast service</a>. But if you want to venture out for your first, third, or fourth cup of the day, here&rsquo;s where our team likes to get their daily jolt:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Hi-Collar</h3>\n<p>Choose your own beans and pouring method at this Japanese inspired cafe.
