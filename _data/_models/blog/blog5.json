From street cafes to rooftops, there’s no shortage of places to eat outside, but for a truly back-to-nature experience (at least in New York terms), you’ve got to eat in one of the city’s parks. Here are our favorite park restaurants.",

Here are our favorite park restaurants.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Central Park: The Loeb Boathouse</h2>\n<p>The Loeb Boathouse, in a 150-year-old boathouse, has been a popular Central Park restaurant since 1954. Come the weekend, forget long brunch lines in the West Village and make reservations here under the waterfront awnings. Order the challah french toast if only for the Grand Marnier banana compote ($18).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thecentralparkboathouse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Loeb Boathouse</a>: E. 72nd St., 212-517-2233</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bryant Park: Bryant Park Grill</h2>\n<p>Bryant Park Grill, an ivy-covered cafe in the back of the New York Public Library&rsquo;s opulent Schwarzman Building overlooking Bryant Park, is one of Midtown&rsquo;s best spots for a power lunch. Ask for a rooftop seat and order the cobb salad with grilled shrimp and maytag blue cheese ($26).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arkrestaurants.com/bryant_park/\" target=\"_blank\">Bryant Park Grill</a>: 25 W. 40th St., 212-840-6500</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Union Square: The Pavilion</h2>\n<p>Located under neoclassical arches on the northern end of Union Square, The Pavilion has a decidedly tropical feel with palm frond fans and potted palms. The menu, inspired by the square&rsquo;s popular farmer&rsquo;s market, is similarly refreshing, with fresh salads and seafood options like branzino with a lemon chimichurri ($33). An extra boon for Sex and the City fans: Carrie Bradshaw attended a party here when it was called Luna Park, which shuttered in 2007.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thepavilionnyc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Pavilion</a>: 20 Union Sq. W., 212-677-7818</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Madison Square Park: The original Shake Shack</h2>\n<p>After three successful summer runs between 2001 and 2003, Madison Square hot dog cart Shake Shack received the necessary permits to become a brick-and-mortar kiosk in 2004. Architecture firm SITE Environmental Design built the now-iconic wooden structure to blend in with its leafy surroundings. Before you head out for a Shack burger (from $5), be sure to check the Shack Cam to see how long the line is.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.shakeshack.com/location/madison-square-park/\" target=\"_blank\">Shake Shack</a>: Madison Ave. at E. 23rd St., 646-747-2606</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Riverside Park: Boat Basin Cafe</h2>\n<p>The cafe, which is one of the Upper West Side&rsquo;s most popular summer hangouts, serves barbecue on paper plates and cocktails in plastic cups. Go for the simple menu of burgers and sandwiches (from $9) as the sun sets over the Hudson, or the breakfast specials (from $8) served from 11am until 3pm on Saturdays and Sundays.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.boatbasincafe.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Boat Basin Cafe</a>: W. 79th St., 212-496-5542</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
