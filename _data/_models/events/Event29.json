Often called the Chinese New Year, this pan-Asian affair showcases the dances and costumes of various countries, including Korea and Taiwan. Come early to view the procession, which begins winding from Canal Street to East Broadway at 1:00 p.m., before culminating with performances and food vendors at Sara D. Roosevelt Park.
