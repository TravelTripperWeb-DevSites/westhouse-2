The fireworks are set off from barges near Pier 17, in Manhattan. In the city, South Street Seaport is a great place to catch the celebration down by the water. For a more direct view, head across the river to Brooklyn Bridge Park. Fornino, a trendy pizzeria with a rooftop patio directly on the riverfront is hosting an open bar dinner party during the fireworks. Nearby, Berry Park&rsquo;s rooftop bar in Greenpoint also offers great views of the Manhattan skyline.</p>"}
