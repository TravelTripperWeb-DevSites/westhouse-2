The story&mdash;an Andrew Upton adaptation of an early Anton Checkhov work&mdash;takes place in a country house set in late 20th-century Russia. At the center of the story are Anna Petrovna (Blanchett), a widow, and Platonov (Roxburgh) a razor-edged school teacher. Petrovna is hosting a dinner party for her 40th birthday, and the events that unfold take place over the course of the evening soiree. Prepare for a tense, funny, and remarkably familiar three hours with lots of vodka and typical Checkhov nostalgia.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tickets are available from $79 to $149, and can be purchased at <a href=\"https://www.thepresentbroadway.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Present&rsquo;s official website.</a></p>","image":{"url":"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/92_368_1000/media/The-Present-Broadway-westhouse-hotel.jpg"}}
