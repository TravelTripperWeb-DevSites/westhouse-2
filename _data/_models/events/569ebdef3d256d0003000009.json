Leading the pack is the 22nd annual Armory Show, which showcases over 200 international galleries on Piers 92 and 94. Pulse, held at Chelsea&rsquo;s Metropolitan Pavilion on 18th Street, focuses more on emerging galleries than the Armory Show. Also in Chelsea, CLIO Art Fair bills itself as the &ldquo;anti-fair for independent artists,&rdquo; and only shows works by artists without any exclusive NYC gallery representation. It&rsquo;s a great way to see contemporary art that hasn&rsquo;t been filtered through the gallery system.</p>\n<p><br />For more information, visit the <a class=\"\" href=\"https://www.thearmoryshow.com/\">Armory Show</a>, <a href=\"https://pulse-art.com/new-york/about-pulse/\">Pulse</a> and <a class=\"\" href=\"https://www.clioartfair.com/\">Clio</a> websites. </p>","definition":""}
